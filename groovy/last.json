Temporary files will be automatically deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.\n\nThe default cleanup observer uses `publishDir` directives to determine whether a file should be published before it is deleted. Setting `boost.cleanup = 'v2'` will use an alternate cleanup observer which uses the new workflow publish definition instead of `publishDir` to track publishing.\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Resume is not supported with automatic cleanup at this time. Deleted tasks will be re-executed on a resumed run. Resume will be supported when this feature is finalized in Nextflow.\n\n- Helper files and log files created by Nextflow (e.g. `.command.run`, `.command.log`) are not deleted. Consider using a cleanup policy on the underlying filesystem or object storage to delete these files automatically over time.\n\n- Input files that are staged into the work directory (e.g. from an HTTP/FTP server or S3 bucket) are not deleted.\n\n- Files created by operators (e.g. `collectFile`, `splitFastq`) cannot be tracked and so are not deleted. For optimal performance, consider refactoring such operators into processes:\n\n  - Splitter operators such as `splitFastq` can also be used as functions in a native process:\n\n    ```groovy\n    process SPLIT_FASTQ {\n      input:\n      val(fastq)\n\n      output:\n      path(chunks)\n\n      exec:\n      chunks = splitFastq(fastq, file: true)\n    }\n    ```\n\n  - The `collectFile` operator can be replaced with `mergeText` (in this plugin) in a native process. See the `examples` directory for example usage.\n\n**`boost.cleanupInterval`**\n\nSpecify how often to scan for cleanup (default: `'60s'`).\n\n### Functions\n\n**`fromJson( source: Path | String )`**\n\nLoad a value from JSON.\n\n**`toJson( value, pretty = false ) -> String`**\n\nConvert a value to JSON.\n\n**`fromYaml( source: Path | String )`**\n\nLoad a value from YAML.\n\n**`toYaml( value ) -> String`**\n\nConvert a value to YAML.\n\n**`mergeCsv( records, path, [opts] )`**\n\nSave a list of records (i.e. tuples or maps) to a CSV file.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `header`: When `true`, the keys of the first record are used as the column names (default: `false`). Can also be a list of column names.\n\n- `sep`: The character used to separate values (default: `','`).\n\n**`mergeText( items, path, [opts] )`**\n\nSave a list of items (i.e. files or strings) to a text file.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `keepHeader`: Prepend the resulting file with the header of the first file (default: `false`). The number of header lines can be specified using the `skip` option, to determine how many lines to remove from each file.\n\n- `newLine`: Append a newline character after each entry (default: `false`).\n\n- `skip`: The number of lines to skip at the beginning of each entry (default: `1` when `keepHeader` is true, `0` otherwise).\n\n**`request( url: String, [opts] )`**\n\nMake an HTTP request. Returns the underlying [HttpURLConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/HttpURLConnection.html).\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `body: String`\n\n  The request body.\n\n- `headers: Map<String,String>`\n\n  Map of request headers.\n\n- `method: String`\n\n  The request method, can be `'get'`, `'post'`, `'head'`, `'options'`, `'put'`, `'delete'`, or `'trace'` (default: `'get'`).\n\n**`template( source: Path | String, binding: Map ) -> String`**\n\nRender a template with the given binding.\n\n### Operators\n\n**`exec( name, body )`**\n\nThe `exec` operator creates and invokes an inline native (i.e. `exec`) process with the given name, as well as a closure which corresponds to the `exec:` section of a native process.\n\nThe inline process can be configured from the config file like any other process, including the use of process selectors (i.e. `withName`).\n\nLimitations:\n\n- Inline process directives are not supported yet.\n\n- The inline exec body should accept a single value and return a single value. Multiple inputs/outputs are not supported yet.\n\n**`scan( [seed], accumulator )`**\n\nThe `scan` operator is similar to `reduce` -- it applies an accumulator function sequentially to each value in a channel -- however, whereas `reduce` only emits the final result, `scan` emits each partially accumulated value.\n\n**`then( onNext, [opts] )`**\n\n**`then( [others...], opts )`**\n\nThe `then` operator is a generic operator that can be used to implement nearly any operator you can imagine.\n\nIt accepts any of three event handlers: `onNext`, `onComplete`, and `onError` (similar to `subscribe`). Each event handler has access to the following methods:\n\n- `emit( value )`: emit a value to the output channel\n\n- `done()`: signal that no more values will be emitted\n\nWhen there is only one source channel, the `done()` method will be called automatically when the source channel sends the `onComplete` event. You can still call it manually, e.g. to finalize the output earlier. When there are multiple source channels, you are responsible for calling `done()` at the appropriate time -- if you don't call it, your operator will wait forever.\n\nWhen there are multiple source channels, `onNext` and `onComplete` events are *synchronized*. This way, you don't need to worry about making your event handlers thread-safe, because they will be invoked on one event at a time.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `onNext( value, [i] )`: Closure that is invoked when a value is emitted by a source channel. Equivalent to providing a closure as the first argument. When there are multiple source channels, the closure is invoked with a second argument corresponding to the index of the source channel.\n\n- `onComplete( [i] )`: Closure that is invoked after the last value is emitted by a source channel. When there are multiple source channels, the closure is invoked with the index of the source channel.\n\n- `onError( error )`: Closure that is invoked when an exception is raised while handling an `onNext` event. It is invoked the exception that caused the error. No further calls will be made to `onNext` or `onComplete` after this event. By default, the error is logged and the workflow is terminated.\n\n- `singleton`: Whether the output channel should be a value (i.e. *singleton*) channel. By default, it is determined by the source channel, i.e. if the source is a value channel then the output will also be a value channel and vice versa.\n\n## Development\n\nThe easiest way to build and test nf-boost locally is to run `make install`. This will build the plugin and install it to your Nextflow plugins directory (e.g. `~/.nextflow/plugins`), using the version defined in `MANIFEST.MF`. Finally, specify the plugin in your Nextflow config with this exact version. You can then use it locally like a regular plugin.\n\nRefer to the [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) README for more information about building and publishing Nextflow plugins.\n"

Sci. 2021, 2100707. https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100707\n\nThe nf-co2footprint plugin generates a detailed TXT carbon footprint report containing the energy consumption, the estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emission and other relevant metrics for each task.\nAdditionally, an HTML report is generated with information about the carbon footprint of the whole pipeline run and containing plots showing, for instance, an overview of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the different processes.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-co2footprint@1.0.0-beta'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed. Run your pipeline with the usual command.\n\nYou can find more information on plugins in the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To test the plugin prior to its first release, refer to the [contributing documentation](contributing/setup.md).\n\n## Credits\n\nThe nf-co2footprint plugin is mainly developed and maintained by [Sabrina Krakau](https://github.com/skrakau) and [J\u00falia Mir-Pedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol) at [QBiC](https://www.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de/).\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n- [Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels)\n- [Paolo Di Tommaso](https://github.com/pditommaso)"

Otherwise, you can configure the following:\n\n```\nk8s {\n    scheduler {\n        name = 'workflow-scheduler'\n        serviceAccount = 'nextflowscheduleraccount'\n        imagePullPolicy = 'IfNotPresent'\n        cpu = '2'\n        memory = '1400Mi'\n        container = 'commonworkflowscheduler/kubernetesscheduler:v1.0'\n        command = null\n        port = 8080\n        workDir = '/scheduler'\n        runAsUser = 0\n        autoClose = false\n        nodeSelector = null\n    }\n}\n```\n\n| Attribute       | Required | Explanation                                                                                                                  |\n|:----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| name            | -        | The name of the pod created                                                                                                  |\n| serviceAccount  | -        | Service account used by the scheduler                                                                                        |\n| imagePullPolicy | -        | Image pull policy for the created pod ([k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy)) |\n| cpu             | -        | Number of cores to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                 |\n| memory          | -        | Memory to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                          |\n| container       | -        | Container image to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                 |\n| command         | -        | Command to start the CWS in the pod.

GITHUB_USERNAME=... GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAIL=... make publish-to-github\n```\n"

        "readme": "# nf-ffq\n\nNextflow plugin to fetch fastq samples using [ffq](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-ffq).\n\n## Get started \n\nThe plugin adds a new channel factory called `channel.ffq()` which can be used to query fastq files.\n\n> [!Note]\n> This plugin requires Nextflow 24.01.0-edge or later.\n\nA simple usage is shown below:\n\n```\ninclude { ffq } from 'plugin/nf-ffq'\n\nchannel\n  .ffq('SRR9990627', filetype: 'fastq', links: 'aws')\n  .view()\n```\n\nRun it using this command:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your script name> -plugins nf-ffq\n```\n\nIt returns: \n\n```\n[SRR9990627, [s3://sra-pub-src-16/SRR9990627/macula_donor_1_S100_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz.1, s3://sra-pub-src-17/SRR9990627/macula_donor_1_S100_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz.1]]\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\nThe `ffq` method can take either a string value representing an accession ID, a string value representing string representing a comma separate list of accession IDs, or a list of string of accession IDs.\n\nThe following options can be specified provided:\n\n| Option \t        | Description \t            |\n|---\t            |---\t                    |\n| `filetype`        | The requested file type, either `fastq` or `sra`\n| `links`           | The link type that should be returned, either `aws`, `gcp`, `ncbi`, `ftp`\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe plugin adds a new `ffq` config scope which supports the following options:\n\n| Config option \t| Description \t            |\n|---\t            |---\t                    |\n| `ffq.endpoint`    | URL of the ffq-api endpoint\n\nFor example:\n```\nffq {\n  endpoint = 'https://ffq.seqera.io'\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n    ./gradlew check\n\n## Run and debug plugin in the development environment\n\nTo run and test the plugin in the development environment, configure a local Nextflow build \nusing the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n\n    ```\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Instruct the plugin build setting to use the local Nextflow code, adding the following \n  line in the file `settings.gradle`: \n   \n    ```\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n  (make sure to not add it more than once..)\n\n3. Compile the plugin along the Nextflow code, with this command:\n\n    ```\n    ./gradlew assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with plugins using the `./launch.sh` script as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command and \n  adding the option `-plugins nf-ffq` to load the built plugin:\n   \n    ```\n    ./launch.sh run ffq.nf -plugins nf-ffq\n    ```\n\n## Package, upload and publish\n\nThe project should hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin,\nthat is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder e.g. `nf-ffq` in this project.\n\nFollowing these step to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes\n   (this file should not be committed in the project repository):\n\n  * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation the plugin project is hosted\n  * `github_username` The GitHub username granting access to the plugin project.\n  * `github_access_token`:  The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes in the plugin repository.\n  * `github_commit_email`:  The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. The following command, package and upload the plugin in the GitHub project releases page:\n\n    ```\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-ffq:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against the [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) \n  project to make the plugin public accessible to Nextflow app. \n"

        "readme": "# nf-float plugin\n\nThis project contains the Nextflow plugin for MemVerge Memory Machine Cloud \n(aka. float).\n\n`FloatGridExecutor` extends the `AbstractGridExecutor` and tells Nextflow how\nto run the workload with `float` command line.  \n\nPlease make sure your nextflow node shares the same work directory with the\nworker nodes/containers.  It should be a shared file system such as NFS or S3FS.\n\nOtherwise, the worker nodes won't be able to see the task files.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License Version 2.0](./LICENSE)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo run `float` with Nextflow, you must install the Nextflow and the float plugin.\n\n__Note__\n\nNextflow and the plugin should be installed on a node that have \naccess to the NFS which is available to all worker nodes.\n\n### Install Nextflow\n\nEnter this command in your terminal:\n```\ncurl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash\n```\nIt creates a file `nextflow` in the current dir.\n\n__Note__:\n\nNextflow requires java 11 or higher.  You may need to install openjdk 11 \nfor your environment.\n\nYou could always find the latest installation\nguide at https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html.\n\n\n### Install nf-float plugin\n\n#### Auto Install\n\nThe `nf-float` plugin is available on the Nextflow community plugins site.\nWhen Nextflow sees following configuration, it will automatically download\nthe plugin.  \n\nJust make sure you have proper internet access.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n```\n\nThis will download the latest version of the plugin.\n\nIf you need a specific version, you can specify the version number like this:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float@0.4.1'\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Manual Install\n\nSometimes you want to deploy a customized plugin.  In this case, you can\ninstall it manually.\n\nGo to the folder where you just install the `nextflow` command line.\nLet's call this folder the Nextflow home directory.\nCreate the float plugin folder with:\n```bash\nmkdir -p .nextflow/plugins/nf-float-<version>\n```\nwhere `<version>` is the version of the float plugin, such as `0.4.1`.  This version number should \nalign with the version in of your plugin and the property in your configuration\nfile. (check the configuration section)\n\nRetrieve your plugin zip file and unzip it in this folder.\nIf everything goes right, you should be able to see two sub-folders:\n\n```bash\n$ ll .nextflow/plugins/nf-float-<version>/\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ec2-user ec2-user    51 Jan  5 07:17 classes\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user    25 Jan  5 07:17 META-INF\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nUsers need to update the default configuration file or supply a configuration\nfile with the command line option `-c`.  Here is a sample of the configuration.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = '/mnt/memverge/shared'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'opcenter.compute.amazonaws.com'\n    username = 'admin'\n    password = 'memverge'\n    nfs = 'nfs://1.2.3.4/mnt/memverge/shared'\n}\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n}\n```\n\n* In the `plugins` section, users must specify the plugin name and version.\n* `workDir` is where we mount the NFS and where Nextflow put the process files.\n* In the `float` section, users must supply the address of the MMCE operation\n  center and the proper credentials.\n* In the `process` scope, we specify `executor = 'float'` to tell Nextflow to execute\n  tasks with the Float executor.\n* In the `process` scope, we can use `ext.float = 'xxx'` to pass extra options to the \n  float command line.  It works the same as `extra`.\n\nAvailable `float` config options: \n\n* `address`: address of your operation center(s).  Separate multiple addresses with `,`.\n* `username`, `password`: the credentials for your operation center\n* `nfs`: the location of the NFS (if using NFS for the work directory)\n* `migratePolicy`: the migration policy used by WaveRider, specified as a map.  Refer to\n              the CLI usage for the list of available options.\n* `vmPolicy`: the VM creation policy, specified as a map.  Refer to the CLI usage\n              for the list of available options.\n* `ignoreTimeLimits`: a boolean.  default to true.  If set to true, the plugin will ignore\n  the time limit of the task.\n* `timeFactor`: a float number.  default to 1.  An extra factor to multiply based \n  on the time supplied by the task.  Add time factor to enlarge the default timeout of the task.  \n  Because WaveRider may take extra time for job migration.\n* `maxCpuFactor`: a float number.  default to 4.  The maximum CPU cores of the instance is set\n  to `maxCpuFactor` * `cpus` of the task.\n* `maxMemoryFactor`: a float number.  default to 4.  The maximum memory of the instance is set\n  to `maxMemoryFactor` * `memory` of the task.\n* `commonExtra`: allows the user to specify other submit CLI options.  This parameter\n                 will be appended to every float submit command.\n* `maxParallelTransfers`: an integer.  default to 4.  The maximum number of parallel transfers\n  for the task happened on the worker node.  Note the actual concurrency is the minimum of this \n  value and the number of available cores.\n\n### Configure with environment variables\n\nThe plugin allows the user to set credentials with environment variables.\nIf the credentials are not available in the configuration file, it will try\nreading these environment variables.\n\n* `MMC_ADDRESS` for operation center address.  Separate multiple addresses with `,`.\n* `MMC_USERNAME` for login username\n* `MMC_PASSWORD` for login password\n\n\n### Configure with Nextflow secrets\n\nUser can use Nextflow secrets to input the credentials.  Here is an example:\n\n```bash\nnextflow secrets set MMC_USERNAME \"...\"\nnextflow secrets set MMC_PASSWORD \"...\"\n```\n\nIn the configuration file, you can reference the secrets like this:\n\n```groovy\nfloat {\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n}\n```\n\nIf the secret is not available, Nextflow reports error like this:\n\n```\nUnknown config secret 'MMC_USERNAME'\n```\n\n### Configuration best practices\n\nWhen you are using s3, it's recommended to update the aws client configurations\nbased on your environment and the workload.  Here is an example:\n```groovy\naws {\n  // recommended aws client settings\n  client {\n    maxConnections = 20 // Increase this number to allow large concurrency\n    maxErrorRetry = 10 // Increase the number of retries if needed\n    connectionTimeout = 60000 // timeout in milliseconds, 60 seconds\n    socketTimeout = 60000     // timeout in milliseconds, 60 seconds\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDue to a compatibility issue between MMC and AWS, when using the us-east-1 region, \nyou must explicitly specify the endpoint as `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. \nFor example:\n```groovy\naws {\n    client {\n        endpoint = 'https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you are sure that the workflow file is properly composed, it's recommended to\nset proper error strategy and retry limit in the process scope to make sure\nthe workflow can be completed.\nHere is an example:\n```groovy\nprocess {\n  errorStrategy='retry'\n  maxRetries=5  \n}\n```\n\n### Configure s3 work directory\n\nTo enable s3 as work directory, user need to set work directory to a s3 bucket.\nNote `token` is not supported.\nNote `scratch` is enabled by default.  If you want to disable it, please set `scratch = false`.\n`stageInMode` is set to `copy` by default.  If you want to disable it, please set `stageInMode = 'link'`.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = 's3://bucket/path'\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n    container = 'fedora/fedora-minimal'\n    disk = '120 GB'\n}\n\npodman.registry = 'quay.io'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'op.center.address'\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n}\n\naws {\n  accessKey = '***'\n  secretKey = '***'\n  region = 'us-east-2' // optional\n}\n```\n\nYou don't need to specify `nfs` in `float` scope.  The plugin will assemble\nthe `nfs` option automatically.\n\nThe plugin retrieves the s3 credentials in the following order:\n* the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline execution directory\n* read key from `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n* read secret from `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`\n* the default profile in the AWS credentials file located at `~/.aws/credentials`\n* the default profile in the AWS client configuration file located at `~/.aws/config`\n* the temporary AWS credentials provided by an IAM instance role. See IAM Roles documentation for details.\n\nFor detail, check NextFlow's document.\nhttps://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/amazons3.html#security-credentials\n\nTests done for s3 work directory support:\n* trivial sequence and scatter workflow.\n* the test profile of nf-core/rnaseq\n* the test profile of nf-core/sarek\n\nBy default, `scratch` option is set to true, `stageInMode` is set to `copy` for network file system\nsuch as `s3`.\nWhen `scratch` is enabled, the plugin will use the scratch space of the worker node to store the task \nfiles.  This is useful when the task files are large and the network bandwidth is limited.\n\nWhen `scratch` is enabled manually, it's strongly recommended to set `stageInMode = 'copy'` in the \nprocess scope.  This will make sure the task files are copied to the scratch space before the task starts.\n\nIf you want to disable `scratch`, please set `scratch = false` in the process scope.\n\nBecause the scratch space is local, you need to add `disk = '100 GB'` to make sure the task has enough\nspace to run.  The plugin will also check the total input size of the task and make sure the disk space\nis larger than 5 times of the input size.\n\n### Configure s3fs work directory\n\nTo enable s3fs as work directory, user need to set work directory to a s3 bucket.\nNote `token` is optional.  If you don't have a token, you can leave it empty.\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = '/s3/bucket'\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n    container = 'fedora/fedora-minimal'\n}\n\npodman.registry = 'quay.io'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'op.center.address'\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n    nfs = 's3://bucket:/s3/bucket'\n    timeFactor = 2\n}\n\naws {\n  accessKey = '***'\n  secretKey = '***'\n  token = '***'\n  region = 'us-east-2'\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin retrieves the s3 credentials in the following order:\n* the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline execution directory\n* read key from `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n* read secret from `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`\n* read token from `AWS_TOKEN` or `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` if applicable\n* the default profile in the AWS credentials file located at `~/.aws/credentials`\n* the default profile in the AWS client configuration file located at `~/.aws/config`\n* the temporary AWS credentials provided by an IAM instance role. See IAM Roles documentation for details.\n\n\n### Configure fusion FS over s3\n\nSince release 0.3.0, we support fusion FS over s3.  To enable fusion, you need to add following configurations\n```groovy\nwave.enabled = true // 1\n\nfusion {\n  enabled = true // 2\n  exportStorageCredentials = true // 3\n  exportAwsAccessKeys = true // 4\n}\n```\n1. fusion needs wave support.\n2. enable fusion explicitly\n3. export the aws credentials as environment variable.\n4. same as 3.  Different nextflow versions may require different option.  Supply both 3 & 4 if you are not sure.\n\nIn additional, you may want to:\n* point your work directory to a location in s3.\n* specify your s3 credentials in the `aws` scope.\n\nWhen fusion is enabled, you can find similar submit command line in your `.nextflow.log`\n```bash\nfloat -a <op-center-address> -u admin -p *** submit\n    --image 'wave.seqera.io/wt/dfd4c4e2d48d/biocontainers/mulled-v2-***:***-0'\n    --cpu 12\n    --mem 72\n    --job /tmp/nextflow5377817282489183149.command.run\n    --env FUSION_WORK=/fusion/s3/cedric-memverge-test/nf-work/work/31/a4b682beb93c944fbd3a342ffc41c5\n    --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***\n    --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***\n    --env 'FUSION_TAGS=[.command.*|.exitcode|.fusion.*](nextflow.io/metadata=true),[*](nextflow.io/temporary=true)'\n    --extraContainerOpts --privileged\n    --customTag nf-job-id:znzjht-4\n```\n* the task image is wrapped by a layer provided by wave.\n  __note__: releases prior to MMC 2.3.1 has bug that fails the image pull requests to the wave registry.  \n  please upgrade to the latest MMC master.\n* `FUSION_WORK` and `FUSION_TAGS` is added as environment variables.\n* aws credentials is added as environment variables.\n* use `extraContainerOpts` to make sure we run the container in privileged mode.\n  __note__: this option requires MMC 2.3 or later.\n\nTests for the fusion support.\n* trivial sequence and scatter workflow.\n* the test profile of nf-core/rnaseq\n* the test profile of nf-core/sarek\n\n### Configure VM creation and migration policies\n\nWhile the VM and migration policies can be specified like any CLI option via `float.commonExtra`,\nthey can also be specified using the config options `float.vmPolicy` and `float.migratePolicy` as maps:\n\n```groovy\nfloat {\n    vmPolicy = [\n        spotFirst: true,\n        retryLimit: 3,\n        retryInterval: '10m'\n    ]\n\n    migratePolicy = [\n        cpu: [upperBoundRatio: 90, upperBoundDuration: '10s'],\n        mem: [lowerBoundRatio: 20, upperBoundRatio: 90]\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Process definition\n\nFor each process, users could supply their requirements for the CPU, memory and container image using the standard Nextflow process directives.\nHere is an example of a hello world workflow.\n\n```groovy\nprocess sayHello {\n  executor 'float'\n  container 'cactus'\n  cpus 2\n  memory 4.GB\n  disk 50.GB\n  time '1h'\n\n  output:\n    stdout\n\n  \"\"\"\n  echo \"Hello from Nextflow!\"\n  \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n  sayHello | view { it.trim() }\n}\n```\n\nThe following process directives are supported for specifying task resources:\n\n* `conda` (only when using [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/))\n* `container`\n* `cpus`\n* `disk` (controls the size of the volume of the workload, minimal size is 40 GB)\n* `machineType`\n* `memory`\n* `resourceLabels`\n* `time`\n\n## Run the Workflow\n\nUse the `nextflow` command to run the workflow.  We need to include our configuration\nfile and task file as arguments.  Here is an example.\n\n```bash\n./nextflow run samples/tutorial.nf -c conf/float-rt.conf\n```\n\n## Unit testing \n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo run and test the plugin in a development environment, \nconfigure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew compileGroovy\n    ```\n   \n4. Run unittest of the package:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew check\n    ```\n\n5. Packaging:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew assemble\n    ```\n\n6. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-float` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run samples/hello.nf -c conf/float-rt.conf -plugins nf-float\n    ```\n\n## Package\n\nRun following command to create the plugin zip.\n\n```bash\n./gradlew makeZip\n```\n\nThe output is available at `./plugins/nf-float/build/libs/`\n"

        "readme": "# nf-ga4gh plugin \n \nThis plugin implements the support for GA4GH APIs for Nextflow. Currently only supports the [Task Execution Service (TES) API](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas).\n\nSee the [Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html) for more information about developing plugins.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe [Task Execution Schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas) (TES) project by the [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org) standardization initiative is an effort to define a standardized schema and API for describing batch execution tasks in a portable manner.\n\nNextflow supports the TES API via the `tes` executor, which allows the submission of workflow tasks to a remote execution backend exposing a TES API endpoint.\n\nThe pipeline processes must specify the Docker image to use by defining the `container` directive, either in the pipeline script or the `nextflow.config` file. Additionally, the pipeline work directory must be accessible to the TES backend.\n\nTo enable this executor, add the following settings to your Nextflow configuration:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-ga4gh'\n}\n\nprocess.executor = 'tes'\ntes.endpoint = '<endpoint>'\n```\n\nThe default endpoint is `http://localhost:8000`. It is important that the endpoint is specified without the trailing slash; otherwise, the resulting URLs will not be normalized and the requests to TES will fail.\n\nThe TES API supports multiple forms of authentication:\n\n```groovy\n// basic\ntes.basicUsername = '<username>'\ntes.basicPassword = '<password>'\n\n// API key\ntes.apiKeyParamMode = '<mode>' // 'query' or 'header'\ntes.apiKeyParamName = '<param-name>'\ntes.apiKey = '<key>'\n\n// OAuth\ntes.oauthToken = '<token>'\n```\n\nYou can deploy a local [Funnel](https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/) server using the following command:\n\n```bash\n./funnel server --Server.HTTPPort 8000 --LocalStorage.AllowedDirs $HOME run\n```\n\nWhile the TES API is designed to abstract workflow managers from direct storage access, Nextflow still needs to access the shared work directory used by your TES endpoint. For example, if your TES endpoint is located in Azure and uses Azure Blob storage to store the work directory, you still need to provide the necessary Azure credentials for Nextflow to access the Blob storage.\n\n## Plugin structure\n                    \n- `settings.gradle`\n    \n    Gradle project settings. \n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh`\n    \n    The plugin implementation base directory.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/build.gradle` \n    \n    Plugin Gradle build file. Project dependencies should be added here.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` \n    \n    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.hello.HelloPlugin`.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`\n    \n    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/main` \n\n    The plugin implementation sources.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/test` \n\n    The plugin unit tests. \n\n\n## Unit testing \n\nTo run your unit tests, run the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-ga4gh` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-ga4gh\n    ```\n\n## Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n## Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-ga4gh`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-ga4gh:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-gpt plugin\n \nnf-gpt is an experimental plugin to integrate GPT prompts into Nextflow scripts. It allows submitting\nprompts via OpenAI API and collect the response in form of structured data for downstream analysis.\n\n## Get started\n\n1. Configure the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key in your environment by using the following variable:\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>\n```\n\n2. Add the following snippet at the beginning of your script:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { gptPromptForText } from 'plugin/nf-gpt'\n```\n\n3. Use the `gptPromptForText` operator to perform a ChatGPT prompt and get the response.\n\n```\ninclude { gptPromptForText } from 'plugin/nf-gpt'\n\nprintln gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke')\n\n```\n\n4. run using Nextflow as usual\n\n```\nnextflow run <my script>\n```\n\n5. See the folder [examples] for more examples.\n\n\n## Reference \n\n### Function `gptPromptForText` \n\nThe `gptPromptForText` function carries out a Gpt chat prompt and return the corresponding message as response as a string. Example: \n\n\n```nextflow\nprintln gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke')\n```\n\n\nWhen the option `numOfChoices` is specified the response is a list of strings.\n\n```nextflow\ndef response =  gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke', numOfChoices: 3)\nfor( String it : response )\n  println it\n```\n\nAvailable options:\n\n\n| name            | description                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `logitBias`     | Accepts an object mapping each token (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100 |\n| `model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`)                                                                               |\n| `maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion                                                        |\n| `numOfChoices`  | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message (default: 1)                                                 |\n| `temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`)                                                               |\n\n\n### Function `gptPromptForData` \n\nThe `gptPromptForData` function carries out a GPT chat prompt and returns the response as a list of \nobjects having the schema specified. For example: \n\n```nextflow \n\ndef query = '''\n        Extract information about a person from In 1968, amidst the fading echoes of Independence Day, \n        a child named John arrived under the calm evening sky. This newborn, bearing the surname Doe, \n        marked the start of a new journey.\n        '''\n\ndef response = gptPromptForData(query, schema: [firstName: 'string', lastName: 'string', birthDate: 'date (YYYY-MM-DD)'])\n\nprintln \"First name: ${response[0].firstName}\"\nprintln \"Last name: ${response[0].lastName}\"\nprintln \"Birth date: ${response[0].birthDate}\"\n```\n\n\nThe following options are available: \n\n\n| name            | description |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| `model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`) |\n| `maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion |\n| `schema`        | The expected strcuture for the result object represented as map object in which represent the attribute name and the value the attribute type |\n| `temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`) |\n\n\n### Configuration file \n\nThe following config options can be specified in the `nextflow.config` file: \n\n\n| name            | description |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| `gpt.apiKey`        | Your OpenAI API key. If missing it uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable | \n| `gpt.endpoint`      | The OpenAI endpoint (defualt: `https://api.openai.com`)   |\n| `gpt.model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`) |\n| `gpt.maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion |\n| `gpt.temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`) |\n\n\n## Development \n\nTo build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-gpt` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-gpt\n    ```\n\n### Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n### Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-gpt`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1.

        "readme": "# nf-hello plugin \n \nThis project contains a simple Nextflow plugin called `nf-hello` which provides examples of different plugin extensions:\n\n- A custom trace observer that prints a message when the workflow starts and when the workflow completes\n- A custom channel factory called `reverse`\n- A custom operator called `goodbye`\n- A custom function called `randomString`\n\nNOTE: If you want to use this project as a starting point for a custom plugin, you must rename the `plugins/nf-hello` folder and update `settings.gradle` with your plugin name.\n\nSee the [Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html) for more information about developing plugins.\n\n## Plugin structure\n                    \n- `settings.gradle`\n    \n    Gradle project settings. \n\n- `plugins/nf-hello`\n    \n    The plugin implementation base directory.\n\n- `plugins/nf-hello/build.gradle` \n    \n    Plugin Gradle build file. Project dependencies should be added here.\n\n- `plugins/nf-hello/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` \n    \n    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.hello.HelloPlugin`.\n\n- `plugins/nf-hello/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`\n    \n    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).\n\n- `plugins/nf-hello/src/main` \n\n    The plugin implementation sources.\n\n- `plugins/nf-hello/src/test` \n\n    The plugin unit tests. \n\n## Plugin classes\n\n- `HelloConfig`: shows how to handle options from the Nextflow configuration\n\n- `HelloExtension`: shows how to create custom channel factories, operators, and fuctions that can be included into pipeline scripts\n\n- `HelloFactory` and `HelloObserver`: shows how to react to workflow events with custom behavior\n\n- `HelloPlugin`: the plugin entry point\n\n## Unit testing \n\nTo run your unit tests, run the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-hello` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-hello\n    ```\n\n## Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n## Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-hello`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-hello:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-ignite\n\nThis project implements a [Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) executor for [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow).\n\n[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) is an in-memory data-grid and clustering platform, and can be used to run Nextflow in a \"cluster\" or \"daemon\" mode.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Java 8\n* Nextflow 21.01.x or later\n\nStarting in Nextflow version 22.01.0-edge, the `nf-ignite` plugin must be explicitly enabled in order to use the Ignite executor.\n\n## Cluster setup\n\nIn order to setup a cluster you will need to run a cluster daemon on each node in your cluster. If you want to use Docker containers with Nextflow, the Docker engine must be installed and be running on each node.\n\nIn its simplest form just launch the Nextflow daemon in each cluster node as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -bg\n```\n\nThe command line option `-bg` launches the node daemon in the background. The output is stored in the log file `.node-nextflow.log`. The daemon process `PID` is saved in the file `.nextflow.pid` in the same folder.\n\n### Multicast discovery\n\nBy default, the Ignite daemon tries to automatically discover all members in the cluster by using the network *multicast* discovery. Note that NOT all networks support this feature (for example Amazon AWS does not).\n\nYou can use the [iperf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf/) tool to check if multicast is available in your network. To test multicast, open a terminal on two machines within the network and run the following command in the first one `iperf -s -u -B 228.1.2.4 -i 1` and `iperf -c 228.1.2.4 -u -T 32 -t 3 -i 1` on the second. If data is being transferred then multicast is working.\n\nIgnite uses the multicast group `228.1.2.4` and port `47400` by default. You can change these values, by using the `cluster.join` command line option, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -cluster.join multicast:224.2.2.3:55701\n```\n\nIn case multicast discovery is not available in your network, you can try one of the following alternative methods:\n\n### Shared file system\n\nSimply provide a path shared across the cluster by a network file system, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -bg -cluster.join path:/net/shared/cluster\n```\n\nThe cluster members will use that path to discover each other.\n\n### IP addresses\n\nProvide a list of pre-configured IP addresses on the daemon launch command line, for example:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -cluster.join ip:10.0.2.1,10.0.2.2,10.0.2.4\n```\n\n### Advanced options\n\nThe following cluster node configuration options can be used.\n\n| Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| join                          | IP address(es) of one or more cluster nodes to which the daemon will join.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| group                         | The name of the cluster to which this node join.

In order to execute your pipeline in the Ignite cluster you will need to use the Ignite executor, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your pipeline> -process.executor ignite\n```\n\nIf your network does no support multicast discovery, you will need to specify the `joining` strategy as you did for the cluster daemons. For example, using a shared path:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your pipeline> -process.executor ignite -cluster.join path:/net/shared/path\n```\n\nResource requests and other job characteristics can be controlled using the `cpus`, `disk`, and `memory` process directives.\n\n## MPI Execution\n\nNextflow is able to deploy and self-configure an Ignite cluster on demand, taking advantage of the Open [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) standard that is commonly available in grid and supercomputer facilities.\n\nIn this scenario a Nextflow workflow needs to be executed as an MPI job. Under the hood Nextflow will launch a *driver* process in the first of the nodes, allocated by your job request, and an Ignite daemon in the remaining nodes.\n\nIn practice you will need a launcher script to submit an MPI job request to your batch scheduler/resource manager. The batch scheduler must reserve the compute nodes in an exclusive manner to avoid having multiple Ignite daemons running on the same node. Nextflow must be launched using the `mpirun` utility, as if it were an MPI application, specifying the `--pernode` option.\n\n### Platform LSF\n\nThe following example shows a launcher script for the [Platform LSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF/) resource manager:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#BSUB -oo output_%J.out\n#BSUB -eo output_%J.err\n#BSUB -J <job name>\n#BSUB -q <queue name>\n#BSUB -W 02:00\n#BSUB -x\n#BSUB -n 80\n#BSUB -M 10240\n#BSUB -R \"span[ptile=16]\"\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nmpirun --pernode nextflow run <your-project-name> -with-mpi [pipeline parameters]\n```\n\nIt requests 5 nodes (80 processes, with 16 cpus per node). The `-x` directive allocates the node in an exclusive manner. Nextflow needs to be executed using the `-with-mpi` command line option. It will automatically use `ignite` as the executor.\n\nThe variable `NXF_CLUSTER_SEED` must contain an integer value (in the range 0-16777216) that will unequivocally identify your cluster instance. In the above example it is randomly generated by using the [shuf](http://linux.die.net/man/1/shuf) Linux tool.\n\n### Univa Grid Engine\n\nThe following example shows a launcher script for the [Univa Grid Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univa_Grid_Engine) (aka SGE):\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#$ -cwd\n#$ -j y\n#$ -o <output file name>\n#$ -l virtual_free=10G\n#$ -q <queue name>\n#$ -N <job name>\n#$ -pe ompi 5\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nmpirun --pernode nextflow run <your-project-name> -with-mpi [pipeline parameters]\n```\n\nAs in the previous script it allocates 5 processing nodes. UGE/SGE does not have an option to reserve a node in an exclusive manner. A common workaround is to request the maximum amount of memory or cpus available in the nodes of your cluster.\n\n### SLURM\n\nWhen using SLURM you will need to use `srun` instead of `mpirun` in your launcher script. For example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=<job name>\n#SBATCH --output=<log file %j>\n#SBATCH --ntasks=5\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nsrun nextflow run hello.nf -with-mpi\n```\n\nAs before, this allocates 5 processing nodes (`--ntasks=5`) and each node will be able to use up to 16 cpus (`--cpus-per-task=16`). When using SLURM it's not necessary to allocate compute nodes in an exclusive manner. It's even possible to launch more than one Nextflow daemon instance per node, though not suggested.\n\nTo submit the pipeline execution create a file like the above, then use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch <launcher script name>\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor development include the nextflow build in the `settings.gradle` file, then use `./launch.sh` with the usual NF \ncommand line options.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-iridanext plugin\n\nThis project contains a plugin for integrating Nextflow pipelines with [IRIDA Next][irida-next]. In particular, it will enable a pipeline to produce output consistent with the IRIDA Next [pipeline standards][].\n\n# Getting started\n\n## Scenario 1: Minimal configuration\n\nThe following is the minimal configuration needed for this plugin.\n\n**nextflow.config**\n\n```conf\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext'\n}\n\niridanext {\n    enabled = true\n    output {\n        path = \"${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen run with a pipeline (e.g., the [IRIDA Next Example pipeline][iridanextexample]), the configuration will produce the following JSON output in a file `${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz`.\n\n_Note: `${params.outdir}` is optional and is used in the case where the file should be written to the output directory specified by `--outdir`._\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis file conforms to the standards as defined in the [IRIDA Next Pipeline Standards][iridanext-pipeline-standards] document.\n\n## Scenario 2: Including files\n\nTo include files to be saved within IRIDA Next, you can define path match expressions under the `iridanext.output.files` section. The **global** section is used for global output files for the pipeline while the **samples** is used for output files associated with particular samples (matching to sample identifiers is automatically performed).\n\n**nextflow.config**\n\n```conf\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext'\n}\n\niridanext {\n    enabled = true\n    output {\n        path = \"${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz\"\n        overwrite = true\n        files {\n            global = [\"**/summary/summary.txt.gz\"]\n            samples = [\"**/assembly/*.assembly.fa.gz\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration will produce the following example JSON output:\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [{ \"path\": \"summary/summary.txt.gz\" }],\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": [{ \"path\": \"assembly/SAMPLE1.assembly.fa.gz\" }],\n      \"SAMPLE3\": [{ \"path\": \"assembly/SAMPLE3.assembly.fa.gz\" }],\n      \"SAMPLE2\": [{ \"path\": \"assembly/SAMPLE2.assembly.fa.gz\" }]\n    }\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {}\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFiles are matched to samples using the `meta.id` map used by [nf-core formatted modules][nf-core-meta-map]. The matching key (`id` in `meta.id`) can be overridden by setting:\n\n```conf\niridanext.output.files.idkey = \"newkey\"\n```\n\n## Scenario 3: Including metadata\n\nMetadata associated with samples can be included by filling in the the `iridanext.output.metadata.samples` section, like below:\n\n**nextflow.config**\n\n```conf\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext'\n}\n\niridanext {\n    enabled = true\n    output {\n        path = \"${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz\"\n        overwrite = true\n        metadata {\n            samples {\n                csv {\n                    path = \"**/output.csv\"\n                    idcol = \"column1\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will parse a CSV file for metadata. The `csv.path` keyword specifies the file to parse. The `csv.idcol` defines the column that should match to the sample identifiers.\n\nIf there exists an example CSV file like the following:\n\n**output.csv**\n| column1 | b | c |\n|--|--|--|\n| SAMPLE1 | 2 | 3 |\n| SAMPLE2 | 4 | 5 |\n| SAMPLE3 | 6 | 7 |\n\nThen running the pipeline will produce an output like the following:\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": { \"b\": \"2\", \"c\": \"3\" },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": { \"b\": \"4\", \"c\": \"5\" },\n      \"SAMPLE3\": { \"b\": \"6\", \"c\": \"7\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe CSV parser will only include metadata in the final output JSON for sample identifiers in the CSV file (defined in the column specified by `csv.idcol`) that match to sample identifiers in the pipeline [meta map][nf-core-meta-map] (the key in the meta map defined using `iridanext.output.files.idkey`).\n\n### JSON metadata\n\nIf, instead of parsing a CSV file, you wish to parse metadata from a JSON file, then you can replace the `csv {}` configuration section above with:\n\n```conf\njson {\n    path = \"**/output.json\"\n}\n```\n\nFor example, a JSON file like the following:\n\n**output.json**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"SAMPLE1\": {\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\n    \"key2\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  },\n  \"SAMPLE2\": {\n    \"key1\": \"value2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWould result in the following output:\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": { \"key1\": \"value1\" },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": { \"key2\": [\"a\", \"b\"] }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Flatten metadata\n\nSetting the configuration value `iridanext.output.metadata.samples.flatten = true` will flatten the metadata JSON to a single level of key/value pairs (using dot `.` notation for keys).\n\nThe two scenarios show the difference between `flatten = false` (default) and `flatten = true`.\n\n#### flatten = false\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": {\n        \"key1\": {\n          \"subkey1\": \"value1\",\n          \"subkey2\": \"value2\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": {\n        \"key2\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### flatten = true\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": {\n        \"key1.subkey1\": \"value1\",\n        \"key1.subkey2\": \"value2\"\n      },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": {\n        \"key2.1\": \"a\",\n        \"key2.2\": \"b\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Adjust saved metadata\n\nThe `iridanext.output.metadata.samples.{ignore,keep,rename}` configuration options can be used to adjust what is stored within the metadata JSON structure.\n\n_Note: If `flatten=true` is enabled, then the metadata key names here refer to the flattened names._\n\n#### ignore\n\nSetting `iridanext.output.metadata.samples.ignore = [\"b\"]` in the config (like below) will cause the metadata with the key _b_ to be ignored in the final IRIDA Next output JSON file.\n\nFor example, in the config below:\n\n**nextflow.config**\n\n```config\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext'\n}\n\niridanext {\n    enabled = true\n    output {\n        path = \"${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz\"\n        overwrite = true\n        metadata {\n            samples {\n                ignore = [\"b\"]\n                csv {\n                    path = \"**/output.csv\"\n                    idcol = \"column1\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf this used to load the below CSV file.\n\n**output.csv**\n| column1 | b | c |\n|--|--|--|\n| SAMPLE1 | 2 | 3 |\n| SAMPLE2 | 4 | 5 |\n| SAMPLE3 | 6 | 7 |\n\nThen an output like below is produced (that is, the _b_ column is ignored).\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": { \"c\": \"3\" },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": { \"c\": \"5\" },\n      \"SAMPLE3\": { \"c\": \"7\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### keep\n\nSetting `iridanext.output.metadata.samples.keep = [\"b\"]` is similar to the ignore case, except the listed columns will be kept.\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": { \"b\": \"2\" },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": { \"b\": \"4\" },\n      \"SAMPLE3\": { \"b\": \"6\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### rename\n\nSetting `iridanext.output.metadata.samples.rename` will rename the listed keys to new key names (specified as a Map). For example:\n\n**nextflow.config**\n\n```config\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext'\n}\n\niridanext {\n    enabled = true\n    output {\n        path = \"${params.outdir}/iridanext.output.json.gz\"\n        overwrite = true\n        metadata {\n            samples {\n                rename = [\"b\": \"b_col\"]\n                csv {\n                    path = \"**/output.csv\"\n                    idcol = \"column1\"\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"files\": {\n    \"global\": [],\n    \"samples\": {}\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"samples\": {\n      \"SAMPLE1\": { \"b_col\": \"2\", \"c\": \"3\" },\n      \"SAMPLE2\": { \"b_col\": \"4\", \"c\": \"5\" },\n      \"SAMPLE3\": { \"b_col\": \"6\", \"c\": \"7\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Missing values in metadata\n\nThere are two different scenarios where metadata key/value pairs could be missing for a sample, which result in different behaviours in IRIDA Next.\n\n1. **Ignore key**: If the `key` is left out of the samples metadata in the IRIDA Next JSON, then nothing is written for that `key` for the sample. Any existing metadata under that `key` will remain in IRIDA Next.\n\n2. **Delete key**: If a metadata value is an empty string (`\"key\": \"\"`) or null (`\"key\": null`), then IRIDA Next will remove that particular metadata key/value pair from the sample metadata if it exists. This is the expected scenario if pipeline results contain missing (or N/A) values (deleting older metadata keys prevents mixing up old and new pipeline analysis results in the metadata table).\n\nThe following are the expectations for writing missing values in the final IRIDA Next JSON file (in order to delete the key/value pairs in IRIDA Next).\n\n#### Encoding missing metadata values using JSON\n\nIf the metadata key `b` for **SAMPLE1** is encoded as an empty string `\"\"` or `null` in the JSON file like the below example:\n\n**output.json**\n```json\n{\n  \"SAMPLE1\": {\n    \"a\": \"value1\",\n    \"b\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen the final IRIDA Next JSON file will preserve the empty string/null value in the samples metadata section:\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n```json\n\"metadata\": {\n  \"samples\": {\n    \"SAMPLE1\": { \"a\": \"value1\", \"b\": \"\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Encoding missing metadata values using CSV\n\nIf the metadata key `b` for **SAMPLE1** is left empty in the CSV file like the below two examples:\n\n**output.csv** as table\n| column1 | b | c |\n|--|--|--|\n| SAMPLE1 |  | 3 |\n| SAMPLE2 | 4 | 5 |\n| SAMPLE3 | 6 | 7 |\n\n**output.csv** as CSV\n```\ncolumn1,b,c\nSAMPLE1,,3\nSAMPLE2,4,5\nSample3,6,7\n```\n\nThen the value for `b` for **SAMPLE1** will be written as an empty string in the IRIDA Next JSON file:\n\n**iridanext.output.json.gz**\n```json\n\"metadata\": {\n  \"samples\": {\n    \"SAMPLE1\": { \"b\": \"\", \"c\": \"3\" },\n    \"SAMPLE2\": { \"b\": \"4\", \"c\": \"5\" },\n    \"SAMPLE3\": { \"b\": \"6\", \"c\": \"7\" }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# Development\n\nIn order to build this plugin you will need a Java Development Kit (such as [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)) and [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/index.html). For Ubuntu, this can be installed with:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install default-jdk groovy\n```\n\n## Build and install from source\n\nIn order to build and install the plugin from source, please do the following:\n\n### 1. Build\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/phac-nml/nf-iridanext.git\ncd nf-iridanext\nmake buildPlugins\n```\n\nPlease see the [Nextflow plugins documentation][nextflow-develop-plugins] and the [nf-hello][] example plugin for more details.\n\n### 2. Install\n\n```bash\ncp -r build/plugins/nf-iridanext-0.2.0 ~/.nextflow/plugins\n```\n\nThis copies the compiled plugin files into the Nextflow plugin cache (default `~/.nextflow/plugins`). Please change the version `0.2.0` to the version of the plugin built from source.\n\n### 3. Use\n\nIn order to use the built plugin, you have to specify the exact version in the Nextflow configuration so that Nextflow does not try to update the plugin. That is, in the configuration use:\n\n```conf\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-iridanext@0.2.0'\n}\n```\n\n## Run unit/integration tests\n\nIn order to run the test cases, please clone this repository and run the following command:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\nTo get more information for any failed tests, please run:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check --info\n```\n\n# Example: nf-core/fetchngs\n\nOne use case of this plugin is to structure reads and metadata downloaded from NCBI/ENA for storage in IRIDA Next by making use of the [nf-core/fetchngs][nf-core/fetchngs] pipeline. The example configuration [fetchngs.conf][] can be used for this purpose. To test, please run the following (using [ids.csv][fetchngs-ids.csv] as example data accessions):\n\n```bash\n# Download config and SRA accessions\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phac-nml/nf-iridanext/main/docs/examples/fetchngs/fetchngs.conf\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phac-nml/nf-iridanext/main/docs/examples/fetchngs/ids.csv\n\nnextflow run nf-core/fetchngs -profile singularity --outdir results --input ids.csv -c fetchngs.conf\n```\n\nThis will produce the following output: [iridanext.output.json][fetchngs-out].\n\n# Credits\n\nThis plugin was developed based on the `nf-hello` Nextflow plugin template <https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello>. Other sources of information for development include the [nf-prov][] and [nf-validation][] Nextflow plugins, as well as the [Nextflow documentation][nextflow-docs].\n\n# Legal\n\nCopyright 2023 Government of Canada\n\nOriginal nf-hello project Copyright to respective authors\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\nthis work except in compliance with the License.

        "readme": "# nf-jarvice\n\nThis plugin has been made to submit Nextflow pipelines into a Jarvice cluster.\n\n## Requirements\n\nUser must have a Jarvice cluster `username` and its associated `apikey`.\n\nTo retrieve account API key, from portal, go into **Account** on the right side, and get apikey by clicking on the eye in the API key field.\n\n![API_KEY](apikey.png)\n\nJobs must then be submitted from a folder shared as persistent vault into the cluster (files transfer is not supported for now).\n\nBest solution if vault is not available outside of the cluster is to launch an interactive shell into an `n0` class node. Then ensure current working directory is under `/data` (which is the default persistent vault folder), then pull nextflow tool, add it to current PATH, add Jarvice settings, and execute the pipeline.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will assume user is already connected to a Jarvice cluster, via an interactive `n0` node.\n\n```\ncd /data\nmkdir mytest\ncd mytest\ngit clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow\nexport PATH=/data/mytest/nextflow:$PATH\n```\n\nIn order to use the plugin, user must provide the following information into the `nextflow.config` file of the project. Create file `/data/mytest/nextflow.config` with the following content:\n\n\n```\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-jarvice@0.6.0'\n}\nprocess {\n    executor = 'jarvice'\n    container = 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n    apiUrl = 'https://cloud.nimbix.net/api'\n    machineType = 'n0'\n    vault {\n        name = 'persistent'\n        readonly = false\n        force = false\n    }\n    user {\n        username = 'myusername'\n        apikey = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace apiUrl, machineType, vault, and user (username and apikey) with your Jarvice user values and desired target machines.\n\nContainer value can be let as it, since it should be defined per steps in the nextflow pipeline file.\n\nNow upload your nextflow pipeline file and data. For this example, create file `test.nf` with the following content:\n\n```\n// Declare syntax version\nnextflow.enable.dsl=2\n\nprocess update_message {\n  container 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n  machineType 'n1'\n\n  output:\n    path \"top_hits.txt\"\n\n    \"\"\"\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n    pwd\n    echo Step 1\n    echo \"Smooth Criminal\" > top_hits.txt\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess add_date {\n  container 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n  machineType 'n1'\n\n  input:\n    path top_hits\n\n  output:\n    path \"sequences.txt\"\n\n    \"\"\"\n    echo Step 2\n    echo \\$(cat top_hits.txt) \\$(date) > sequences.txt\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n   update_message | add_date | view\n}\n```\n\nAnd launch it using:\n\n```\nnextflow run test.nf\n```\n\nJarvice plugin will automatically be downloaded and used as executor. Jobs can be seen in Jarvice portal, like any other jobs."

Project dependencies should be added here.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`\n\n    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.Nomad.NomadPlugin`.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`\n\n    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/main`\n\n    The plugin implementation sources.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/test`\n\n    The plugin unit tests.\n\n## `ExtensionPoint`s\n\n`ExtensionPoint` is the basic interface which uses nextflow-core to integrate plugins into it. It's only a basic interface and serves as starting point for more specialized extensions.\n\n## Unit testing\n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo run and test the plugin in a development environment, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow _resources/nextflow\n    ```\n\n2. Generate the nextflow class path\n\n    ```bash\n    cd _resources/nextflow && ./gradlew exportClasspath\n    ```\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ../../ && ./gradlew compileGroovy\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-nomad` to load the plugin:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run main.nf -plugins nf-nomad\n    ```\n\n## Package, upload and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-nomad`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   - `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n\n\n2. Use the following steps to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n\n    - set the desired `version` value in `gradle.properties` and commit the change in the `master` branch\n    - tag the repo with the version\n    - push *all* changes (the tag fill fire the `release` GH action)\n\n    Once the action is finished a new release is created and all related artifacts attached to it\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n    \n    Use the `json` file created in previous steps\n"

        "readme": "# nf-prov\n\nNextflow plugin to render provenance reports for pipeline runs. Now supporting [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/)!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe `nf-prov` plugin requires Nextflow version `23.04.0` or later.\n\n*New in version 1.3.0: requires Nextflow 24.10.0 or later.*\n\nTo enable and configure `nf-prov`, include the following snippet to your Nextflow config and update as needed.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-prov'\n}\n\nprov {\n  enabled = true\n  formats {\n    legacy {\n      file = 'manifest.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, run your Nextflow pipeline. You do not need to modify your pipeline script in order to use the `nf-prov` plugin. The plugin will automatically generate a JSON file with provenance information.\n\n## Configuration\n\n*The `file`, `format`, and `overwrite` options have been deprecated since version 1.2.0. Use `formats` instead.*\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`prov.enabled`\n\nCreate the provenance report (default: `true` if plugin is loaded).\n\n`prov.formats`\n\n*New in version 1.2.0*\n\nConfiguration scope for the desired output formats. The following formats are available:\n\n- `bco`: Render a [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/). Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\n  *New in version 1.3.0*: additional \"pass-through\" options are available for BCO fields that can't be inferred from the pipeline. See [BCO.md](./BCO.md) for more information.\n\n- `dag`: Render the task graph as a Mermaid diagram embedded in an HTML document. Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\n- `legacy`: Render the legacy format originally defined in this plugin (default). Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\nAny number of formats can be specified, for example:\n\n```groovy\nprov {\n  formats {\n    bco {\n      file = 'bco.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n    legacy {\n      file = 'manifest.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`prov.patterns`\n\nList of file patterns to include in the provenance report, from the set of published files. By default, all published files are included.\n\n## Development\n\nRun the following commands to build and test the nf-prov Nextflow plugin. Refer to the [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) README for additional instructions (_e.g._ for publishing the plugin).\n\n```bash\n# (Optional) Checkout relevant feature branch\n# git checkout <branch>\n\n# Create an empty folder for nf-prov and nextflow repos\ngit clone --depth 1 -b STABLE-23.10.x https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n\n# Prepare the nextflow repo\ncd ../nextflow && ./gradlew compile exportClasspath && cd -\n\n# Prepare the nf-prov repo\ngrep -v 'includeBuild' settings.gradle > settings.gradle.bkp\necho \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle.bkp\nmv -f settings.gradle.bkp settings.gradle\n./gradlew assemble\n\n# Launch\n./launch.sh run test.nf -plugins nf-prov\n```\n\n## Package, Upload, and Publish\n\nThe project should hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin,\nthat is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder e.g. `nf-prov` in this project.\n\nFollowing these step to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes\n   (this file should not be committed in the project repository):\n\n  * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation the plugin project is hosted\n  * `github_username` The GitHub username granting access to the plugin project.\n  * `github_access_token`:  The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes in the plugin repository.\n  * `github_commit_email`:  The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Update the `Plugin-Version` field in the following file with the release version:\n\n    ```bash\n    plugins/nf-prov/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n    ```\n\n3. Run the following command to package and upload the plugin in the GitHub project releases page:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-prov:upload\n    ```\n\n4. Create a pull request against the [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) \n  project to make the plugin public accessible to Nextflow app. \n\n"

WHen you launch a pipeline with the `nf-quilt` plugin, it will publish a Quilt package upon workflow completion that contains output files published to S3.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use the `nf-quilt` plugin, you need Nextflow 22.04 (or later) and Python 3.7 (or later).\n\nInstall the [quilt-cli](./quilt-cli) Python package:\n```bash\npip3 install git+https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-quilt.git#subdirectory=quilt-cli\n```\n\nAdd the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` to enable the plugin:\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-quilt'\n}\n```\n\nConfigure the plugin with the `quilt` config scope in your `nextflow.config`. At a minimum, you should specify the package name and registry. You can also specify a list of paths to include in the Quilt package; by default, the plugin will include all output files that were published to S3.\n\n_TIP: It is recommended that you use `publishDir` to select outputs for the Quilt package, rather than `quilt.paths`, so that the Quilt package matches the actual workflow outputs._\n\nHere's an example based on `nf-core/rnaseq`:\n```groovy\nquilt {\n  packageName = 'genomes/yeast'\n  registry = 's3://seqera-quilt'\n  message = 'My commit message'\n  meta = [pipeline: 'nf-core/rnaseq']\n  force = false\n}\n```\n\nFinally, run your Nextflow pipeline with your config file. You do not need to modify your pipeline script in order to use the `nf-quilt` plugin. As long as your pipeline publishes the desired output files to S3, the plugin will automatically publish a Quilt package based on your configuration settings.\n\n## Reference\n\nThe plugin exposes a new `quilt` config scope which supports the following options:\n\n| Config option \t  | Description \t          |\n|---\t              |---\t                      |\n| `quilt.packageName` | Name of package, in the USER/PKG format\n| `quilt.registry`    | Registry where to create the new package\n| `quilt.message`     | The commit message for the new package\n| `quilt.meta`        | Package-level metadata in the form of key-value pairs\n| `quilt.force`       | Skip the parent top hash check and create a new revision even if your local state is behind the remote registry\n| `quilt.paths`       | List of published files (can be path or glob) to include in the package\n\n## Tower\n\nTo use nf-quilt with Nextflow Tower, add the following lines to your pre-run script:\n```bash\nyum install python3-pip -y\nyum install git -y\npip3 install git+https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-quilt.git#subdirectory=quilt-cli\n```\n\n## Development\n\nRefer to the [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) README for instructions on how to build, test, and publish Nextflow plugins.\n"

Please follow the [migration guide](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/latest/migration_guide/) to migrate your code to this new version.\n\nThis [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides functionality that can be used in a Nextflow pipeline to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. The added functionality is:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)\n- \u270d\ufe0f Print log output showing parameters with non-default values\n- \u2705 Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema\n- \ud83d\udccb Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Create a type-casted list from a parsed sample sheet\n\nSupported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV, JSON and YAML.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-schema@2.2.0'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The snippet above will always try to install the specified version. We encourage always pinning the\n> plugin version to make sure the used pipeline will keep working when a new version of `nf-schema`\n> with breaking changes has been released.\n\nYou can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:\n\n```groovy title=\"main.nf\"\ninclude { validateParameters; paramsSummaryLog; samplesheetToList } from 'plugin/nf-schema'\n\n// Validate input parameters\nvalidateParameters()\n\n// Print summary of supplied parameters\nlog.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)\n\n// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet passed to the pipeline through the --input parameter\nch_input = Channel.fromList(samplesheetToList(params.input, \"assets/schema_input.json\"))\n```\n\nOr enable the creation of the help message (using `--help`) in the configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nvalidation {\n  help {\n    enabled: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Java 11 or later\n- <https://github.com/harrel56/json-schema>\n- Nextflow 23.10.0 or later\n\n## Slack channel\n\nThere is a dedicated [nf-schema Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C056RQB10LU) in the [Nextflow Slack workspace](https://nextflow.slack.com).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis plugin was written based on code initially written within the nf-core community,\nas part of the nf-core pipeline template.\n\nWe would like to thank the key contributors who include (but are not limited to):\n\n- J\u00falia Mir Pedrol ([@mirpedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol))\n- Nicolas Vannieuwkerke ([@nvnieuwk](https://github.com/nvnieuwk))\n- Kevin Menden ([@KevinMenden](https://github.com/KevinMenden))\n- Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))\n- Arthur ([@awgymer](https://github.com/awgymer))\n"

        "readme": "# nf-snowflake plugin\n\n## Overview \nnf-snowflake is a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/overview.html) plugin which allows Nextflow pipeline to be run inside [Snowpark Container Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview).\n\nThis plugin requires both Nextflow main process and worker process being run as a container job inside Snowflake. Each process/task in Nextflow will be translated to a [Snowflake Job Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service). The main process can be a job service or a long-running service. Intermediate result between different Nextflow processes will be shared via [stage mount](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/snowflake-stage-volume), so the same stage mount configuration needs to be applied to both main process container and worker process container.\n\n## QuickStart\n\nThis quick start guide assumes you are familiar with both Nextflow and Snowpark Container Service.\n\n1. Create a compute pool\n```\nCREATE COMPUTE POOL cp\nMIN_NODES = 2\nMAX_NODES = 2\nINSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_M\nauto_suspend_secs=3600\n;\n```\n2. Create External Access Integration to allow cloud blob storage service access. You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/additional-considerations-services-jobs#network-egress).\n3. Create Snowflake Internal Stage for working directory and publish directory\n```\ncreate or replace stage nxf_runtime encryption=(type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');\ncreate or replace stage results_st encryption=(type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');\n```\n4. Build the container image for each Nextflow [process](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html), upload the image to [Snowflake Image Registry](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-registry-repository) and update the each process's [container](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#process-container) field.\ne.g.\n```\nprocess INDEX {\n    tag \"$transcriptome.simpleName\"\n    container '/db/schema/repo/image_name:1.0'\n\n    input:\n    path transcriptome\n\n    output:\n    path 'index'\n\n    script:\n    \"\"\"\n    salmon index --threads $task.cpus -t $transcriptome -i index\n    \"\"\"\n}\n```\n5. Add a snowflake profile to the nextflow.config file and enable nf-snowflake plugin e.g.\n```\n...\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-snowflake@0.6.0'\n}\n...\n  snowflake {\n    process.executor = 'snowflake'\n    snowflake {\n      computePool = 'CP'\n      stageMounts = '@nxf_runtime:/config/runtime,@results_st:/config/results'\n      externalAccessIntegrations='EAI'\n    }\n  }\n...\n```\n6. Build the container image for Nextflow main process, you will need to include nf-snowflake plugin. You might consider include your Nextflow pipeline code as well. Here is a sample Dockerfile:\n```\nFROM nextflow/nextflow:24.04.1\n\nRUN nextflow plugin install nf-snowflake\nCOPY . /rnaseq-nf\nWORKDIR /rnaseq-nf\n```\n7. Start the container service to trigger the pipeline:\n```\nexecute job service\nin compute pool CP\nname = NXF_MAIN\nEXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATIONS=(EAI)\nfrom specification '\nspec:\n  container:\n  - name: main\n    image: /db/schena/repo/nf-main:1.0\n    command:\n    - nextflow\n    - run\n    - .\n    - -profile\n    - snowflake\n    - -work-dir\n    - /config/runtime\n    volumeMounts:\n    - name: runtime\n      mountPath: /config/runtime\n    - name: results\n      mountPath: /config/results\n  volumes:\n  - name: runtime\n    source: \"@nxf_runtime\"\n  - name: results\n    source: \"@results_st\"\n'\n;\n```\n"

        "readme": "# SQL DB plugin for Nextflow\n\nThis plugin provides support for interacting with SQL databases in Nextflow scripts.\n\nThe following databases are currently supported:\n\n* [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) (Setup guide [here](docs/aws-athena.md))\n* [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)\n* [H2](https://www.h2database.com)\n* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)\n* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)\n\nNOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW TECHNOLOGY, FEATURES AND CONFIGURATION SETTINGS CAN CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASES.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThis plugin requires Nextflow `22.08.1-edge` or later. You can enable the plugin by adding the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` file:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-sqldb'\n}\n```\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure any number of databases under the `sql.db` configuration scope. For example:\n\n```groovy\nsql {\n    db {\n        foo {\n            url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo'\n            user = 'my-user'\n            password = 'my-password'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above example defines a database named `foo` that connects to a MySQL server running locally at port 3306 and\nusing the `demo` schema, with `my-name` and `my-password` as credentials.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.url`\n: The database connection URL based on the [JDBC standard](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html#db_connection_url).\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.driver`\n: The database driver class name (optional).\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.user`\n: The database connection user name.\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.password`\n: The database connection password.\n\n## Dataflow Operators\n\nThis plugin provides the following dataflow operators for querying from and inserting into database tables.\n\n### fromQuery\n\nThe `fromQuery` factory method queries a SQL database and creates a channel that emits a tuple for each row in the corresponding result set. For example:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { fromQuery } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel.fromQuery('select alpha, delta, omega from SAMPLE', db: 'foo').view()\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`db`\n: The database handle. It must be defined under `sql.db` in the Nextflow configuration.\n\n`batchSize`\n: Query the data in batches of the given size. This option is recommended for queries that may return large a large result set, so that the entire result set is not loaded into memory at once.\n: *NOTE:* this feature requires that the underlying SQL database supports `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.\n\n`emitColumns`\n: When `true`, the column names in the `SELECT` statement are emitted as the first tuple in the resulting channel.\n\n### sqlInsert\n\nThe `sqlInsert` operator collects the items in a source channel and inserts them into a SQL database. For example:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { sqlInsert } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel\n    .of('Hello','world!')\n    .map( it -> tuple(it, it.length) )\n    .sqlInsert( into: 'SAMPLE', columns: 'NAME, LEN', db: 'foo' )\n```\n\nThe above example executes the following SQL statements into the database `foo` (as defined in the Nextflow configuration).\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO SAMPLE (NAME, LEN) VALUES ('HELLO', 5);\nINSERT INTO SAMPLE (NAME, LEN) VALUES ('WORLD!', 6);\n```\n\n*NOTE:* the target table (e.g. `SAMPLE` in the above example) must be created beforehand.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`db`\n: The database handle. It must be defined under `sql.db` in the Nextflow configuration.\n\n`into`\n: The target table for inserting the data.\n\n`columns`\n: The database table column names to be filled with the channel data. The column names order and cardinality must match the tuple values emitted by the channel. The columns can be specified as a list or as a string of comma-separated values.\n\n`statement`\n: The SQL `INSERT` statement to execute, using `?` as a placeholder for the actual values, for example: `insert into SAMPLE(X,Y) values (?,?)`. The `into` and `columns` options are ignored when this option is provided.\n\n`batchSize`\n: Insert the data in batches of the given size (default: `10`).\n\n`setup`\n: A SQL statement that is executed before inserting the data, e.g. to create the target table.\n: *NOTE:* the underlying database should support the *create table if not exist* idiom, as the plugin will execute this statement every time the script is run.\n\n## Querying CSV files\n\nThis plugin supports the [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) database engine, which can query CSV files like database tables using SQL statements.\n\nFor example, create a CSV file using the snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncat <<EOF > test.csv\nfoo,bar\n1,hello\n2,ciao\n3,hola\n4,bonjour\nEOF\n```\n\nThen query it in a Nextflow script:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { fromQuery } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel\n    .fromQuery(\"SELECT * FROM CSVREAD('test.csv') where foo>=2;\")\n    .view()\n```\n\nThe `CSVREAD` function provided by the H2 database engine allows you to query any CSV file in your filesystem. As shown in the example, you can use standard SQL clauses like `SELECT` and `WHERE` to define your query.\n\n## Caveats\n\nLike all dataflow operators in Nextflow, the operators provided by this plugin are executed asynchronously.\n\nIn particular, data inserted using the `sqlInsert` operator is *not* guaranteed to be available to any subsequent queries using the `fromQuery` operator, as it is not possible to make a channel factory operation dependent on some upstream operation.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-synapse\n\nA centralized repository of Nextflow workflows that interact with [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/).\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of Nextflow workflows that interact with Synapse by leveraging the [Synapse Python Client](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient). These workflows are intended to be used in a [Nextflow Tower](https://help.tower.nf/latest/) environment primarily, but they can also be executed using the [Nextflow CLI](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#run) on your local machine.\n\n## Structure\n\nThis repository is organized as follows:\n1. Individual process definitions, or modules, are stored in the `modules/` directory.\n1. Modules are then combined into workflows, stored in the `workflows/` directory. These workflows are intended to capture the entire process of an interaction with Synapse.\n1. Workflows are then represented in the `main.nf` script, which provides an entrypoint for each workflow.\n\n## Usage\n\nOnly one workflow can be used per `nf-synapse` run. The configuration for a workflow run will need to include which workflow you intend to use (indicated by specifying `entry`), along with all of the parameters required for that workflow.\n\nIn the example below, we provide the `entry` parameter `NF_SYNSTAGE` to indicate that we want to run the `NF_SYNSTAGE` workflow. We also provide the `input` parameter, which is required for `NF_SYNSTAGE`.\n\n```\nnextflow run main.nf -profile docker -entry NF_SYNSTAGE --input path/to/input.csv\n```\n\n## Meta-Usage\n\n`NF_SYNAPSE` is designed to be used on either side of a general-purpose Nextflow Workflow to stage input files from Synapse/SevenBridges to an S3 bucket, run a workflow of your choosing, and then index the output files from the S3 bucket back into Synapse. \n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR;\n   A[NF_SYNAPSE:NF_SYNSTAGE]-->B[WORKFLOW];\n   B-->C[NF_SYNAPSE:NF_SYNINDEX];\n```\n\nSee [`demo.py`](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks-Workflows/py-orca/blob/main/demo.py) in `Sage-Bionetworks-Workflows/py-orca` for an example of accomplishing this goal with Python code.\n\n## Authentication\n\nFor Nextflow Tower runs, you can configure your secrets using the [Tower CLI](https://help.tower.nf/23.2/cli/cli/) or the [Tower Web UI](https://help.tower.nf/23.2/). If you are running the workflow locally, you can configure your secrets within the [Nextflow CLI](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/secrets.html).\n\n### Synapse\n\nAll included workflows require a `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN` secret. You can generate a Synapse personal access token using [this dashboard](https://www.synapse.org/#!PersonalAccessTokens:). \n\n### Profiles\n\nCurrent `profiles` included in this repository are:\n1. `docker`: Indicates that you want to run the workflow using Docker for running process containers.\n2. `conda`: Indicates that you want to use a `conda` environment for running process containers.\n\n# Included Workflows\n\n## `NF_SYNSTAGE`: Stage Synapse Files To AWS S3\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this workflow is to automate the process of staging Synapse and SevenBridges files to a Nextflow Tower-accessible location (_e.g._ an S3 bucket). In turn, these staged files can be used as input for a general-purpose (_e.g._ nf-core) workflow that doesn't contain platform-specific steps for staging data. This workflow is intended to be run first in preparation for other data processing workflows.\n\n### Overview\n\n`NF_SYNSTAGE` performs the following steps:\n\n1. Extract all Synapse and SevenBridges URIs (_e.g._ `syn://syn28521174` or `sbg://63b717559fd1ad5d228550a0`) from a given text file.\n1. Download the corresponding files from both platforms in parallel.\n1. Replace the URIs in the text file with their staged locations.\n1. Output the updated text file so it can serve as input for another workflow.\n\n### Quickstart:SYNSTAGE\n\nThe examples below demonstrate how you would stage Synapse files in an S3 bucket called `example-bucket`, but they can be adapted for other storage backends.\n\n1. Prepare your input file containing the Synapse URIs. For example, the following CSV file follows the format required for running the [`nf-core/rnaseq`](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/latest/usage) workflow.\n\n    **Example:** Uploaded to `s3://example-bucket/input.csv`\n\n    ```text\n    sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness\n    foobar,syn://syn28521174,syn://syn28521175,unstranded\n    ```\n\n1. Launch workflow using the [Nextflow CLI](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#run), the [Tower CLI](https://help.tower.nf/latest/cli/), or the [Tower web UI](https://help.tower.nf/latest/launch/launchpad/).\n\n    **Example:** Launched using the Nextflow CLI\n\n    ```console\n    nextflow run main.nf -profile docker -entry NF_SYNSTAGE --input path/to/input.csv\n    ```\n\n1. Retrieve the output file, which by default is stored in a `synstage/` subfolder within the parent directory of the input file. The Synapse and/or Seven Bridges URIs have been replaced with their staged locations. This file can now be used as the input for other workflows.\n\n    **Example:** Downloaded from `s3://example-bucket/synstage/input.csv`\n\n    ```text\n    sample,fastq_1,fastq_2,strandedness\n    foobar,s3://example-scratch/synstage/syn28521174/foobar.R1.fastq.gz,s3://example-scratch/synstage/syn28521175/foobar.R2.fastq.gz,unstranded\n    ```\n\n### Special Considerations for Staging Seven Bridges Files\n\nIf you are staging Seven Bridges files, there are a few differences that you will want to incorporate in your Nextflow run. \n\n1. You will need to configure `SB_AUTH_TOKEN` and `SB_API_ENDPOINT` secrets.\n  - You can generate an authenication token and retrieve your API endpoint by logging in to the Seven Bridges portal you intend to stage files from, such as [Seven Bridges CGC](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/auth/login). From there, click on the \"Developer\" dropdown and then click \"Authentication Token\". A full list of Seven Bridges API endpoints can be found [here](https://sevenbridges-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart/#authentication-and-configuration)\n1. When adding your URIs to your input file, SevenBridges file URIs should have the prefix `sbg://`. \n1. There are two ways to get the ID of a file in SevenBridges:\n   - The first way involves logging into a SevenBridges portal, such as [SevenBridges CGC](https://cgc-accounts.sbgenomics.com/auth/login), navigating to the file and copying the ID from the URL. For example, your URL might look like this: \"https://cgc.sbgenomics.com/u/user_name/project/63b717559fd1ad5d228550a0/\". From this url, you would copy the \"63b717559fd1ad5d228550a0\" piece and combine it with the `sbg://` prefix to have the complete URI `sbg://63b717559fd1ad5d228550a0`.\n   - The second way involves using the [SBG CLI](https://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/files-and-metadata). To get the ID numbers that you need, run the `sb files list` command and specify the project that you are downloading files from. A list of all files in the project will be returned, and you will combine the ID number with the prefix for each file that you want to stage.\n\nNote: `NF_SYNSTAGE` can handle either or both types of URIs in a single input file.\n\n### Parameters\n\nCheck out the [Quickstart](#Quickstart:SYNSTAGE) section for example parameter values.\n\n- **`input`**: (Required) A text file containing Synapse URIs (_e.g._ `syn://syn28521174`). The text file can have any format (_e.g._ a single column of Synapse URIs, a CSV/TSV sample sheet for an nf-core workflow).\n\n- **`outdir`**: (Optional) An output location where the Synapse files will be staged. Currently, this location must be an S3 prefix for Nextflow Tower runs. If not provided, this will default to the parent directory of the input file.\n\n- **`save_strategy`**: (Optional) A string indicating where to stage the files within the `outdir`. Options include:\n    - `id_folders`: Files will be staged in child folders named after the Synapse or Seven Bridges ID of the file. This is the default behavior.\n    - `flat`: Files will be staged in top level of the `outdir`.\n\n### Known Limitations\n\n- The only way for the workflow to download Synapse files is by listing Synapse URIs in a file. You cannot provide a list of Synapse IDs or URIs to a parameter.\n- The workflow doesn't check if newer versions exist for the files associated with the Synapse URIs. If you need to force-download a newer version, you should manually delete the staged version.\n\n## `NF_SYNINDEX`: Index S3 Objects Into Synapse\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this workflow is to automate the process of indexing files in an S3 bucket into Synapse. `NF_SYNINDEX` is intended to be used after a general-purpose (_e.g._ nf-core) workflow that doesn't contain platform-specific steps for uploading/indexing data. \n\n### Overview\n\n`NF_SYNINDEX` performs the following steps:\n\n1. Gets the Synapse user ID for the account that provided the `SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN` secret.\n1. Updates or creates the `owner.txt` file in the S3 bucket to make the current user an owner.\n1. Registers the S3 bucket as an external storage location for Synapse.\n1. Generates a list of all of the objects in the S3 bucket to be indexed.\n1. Recreates the folder structure of the S3 bucket in the Synapse project.\n1. Indexes the files in the S3 bucket into the Synapse project.\n\n### Quickstart:SYNINDEX\n\nThe examples below demonstrate how you would index files from an S3 bucket called `example-bucket` into Synapse.\n\n1. Prepare your S3 bucket by setting the output directory of your general-purpose workflow to a Nextflow Tower S3 bucket. Ideally, you want this S3 bucket to be persistent (not a `scratch` bucket) so that your files will remain accessible indefinitely.\n\n    **Example:** `s3://example-bucket` file structure:\n    ```\n    example-dev-project-tower-bucket\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 child_folder\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 test.txt\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 child_child_folder\n    \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test2.txt\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 test1.txt\n    ```\n\n1. Launch workflow using the [Nextflow CLI](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/cli.html#run), the [Tower CLI](https://help.tower.nf/latest/cli/), or the [Tower web UI](https://help.tower.nf/latest/launch/launchpad/).\n\n    **Example:** Launched using the Nextflow CLI\n\n    ```console\n    nextflow run main.nf -profile docker -entry NF_SYNINDEX --s3_prefix s3://example-bucket --parent_id syn12345678\n    ```\n\n1. Retrieve the output file, which by default is stored in a `S3://example-bucket/synindex/under-syn12345678/` in our example. This folder will contain a mapping of Synapse URIs to their indexed Synapse IDs.\n\n### Parameters\n\nCheck out the [Quickstart](#Quickstart:SYNINDEX) section for example parameter values.\n\n- **`s3_prefix`**: (Required) The S3 URI of the S3 bucket that contains the files to be indexed.\n- **`parent_id`**: (Required) The Synapse ID of the Synapse project or folder that the files will be indexed into.\n- **`filename_string`**: (Optional) A string that will be matched against the names of the files in the S3 bucket. If provided, only files that contain the string will be indexed.\n\n### Known Limitations\n\nAt present, it is not possible for `NF_SYNINDEX` to be run outside of Nextflow Tower. This is due to AWS permissions complications. [Future work](https://sagebionetworks.jira.com/browse/IBCDPE-910) will include enabling the workflow to run on local machines/in virtual machines. \n"

Through this component, it can also implement some detailed function adaptations required by the platform, such as metadata file generation, to ensure the efficient operation and management of the workflow. Its design goal is to extend Tencent Cloud's native support for Nextflow workflows, allowing users to run Nextflow workflows using Tencent Cloud resources in a simple and easy-to-use manner.\n\nwe use [Task Execution Schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas) (TES) protocol as the protocol for nextflow to dock with the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform. Compared to the official plugin, we utilize some custom fields to adapt to the platform features.\n\n## Feature\n\n- Supports docking with Tencent Cloud COS object storage, allowing direct dependence on Tencent Cloud files in files and configurations.\n- Supports docking with Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform for quick access to high-performance elastic computing capabilities (For more information about Tencent Health Genomics Platform, please refer to: [Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform](https://tencentcloud.com/products/omics)).\n\n## Installation\n\n- Make sure that nextflow is already installed on your system.\n- Run the following command to install nf-tencentcloud.\n  ```bash\n  nextflow plugin install nf-tencentcloud\n  ```\n  You can install the nf-tencentcloud plugin that meets your current environment.\n- You can also specify the plugin in the configuration file for installation.\n  ```groovy\n  plugins {\n      id 'nf-tencentcloud@2.0.2'\n  }\n  ```\n- Or you can use the -plugins command line option.\n  ```bash\n  nextflow run <pipeline> -plugins nf-tencentcloud@2.0.2\n  ```\n\n## Using Tencent Cloud Object Storage\n\nThis plugin integrates COS object storage support, and you can conveniently integrate and use Tencent Cloud object storage in nextflow after completing the object storage-related service opening in Tencent Cloud.\n\nGet the key on the [Tencent Cloud CAM console page](https://console.tencentcloud.com/cam/capi) and follow the steps below:\n- Configure the key in the nextflow configuration file.\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      secretId = \"your_secret_id\"\n      secretKey = \"your_secret_key\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- If you use temporary key authorization, you can configure accessToken to enable temporary key.\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      secretId = \"your_secret_id\"\n      secretKey = \"your_secret_key\"\n      accessToken = \"your_access_token\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- After the configuration is complete, you can use COS storage anywhere in the process and configuration, such as:\n  ```groovy\n  workDir = \"cos://test-bucket-1258888888/nextflow/workdir\"\n  ```\n\n## Using Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform\n\nThis plugin integrates the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform executor, and you can enable sandbox in the omics platform for debugging, or wait for the subsequent opening of the external network access terminal interface, and use the elastic computing resources provided by the Tencent Genomics Platform after making the corresponding configuration on your own computer.\n\nIn order to use the Tencent Health Genomics Platform executor, you need to activate and [use the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1234/61467) on Tencent Cloud, and then follow the steps below:\n\n- You need to obtain the request endpoint and accessToken in the omics platform for interface calling and authentication, and configure them in the nextflow configuration file as follows:\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      omics {\n          endpoint = \"http://your_endpoint/api\"\n          accessToken = \"your_access_token\"\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n  > Please note: The accessToken here is used for Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform oauth authentication, which is different from the Tencent Cloud cam temporary authorization accessToken mentioned above, and cannot be mixed.\n  \n- After completing the relevant configuration, set the executor to `tencentcloud-omics` to use the elastic computing capabilities of the Tencent Health Genomics Platform.\n  ```groovy\n  process {\n      executor = 'tencentcloud-omics'\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor more information about contributing issues or pull requests, see our [nf-tencentcloud Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\u3002\n\n## License\n\nnf-tencentcloud is under the Apache-2.0. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Support\n\nThis plugin is developed by Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform team and can be used upon Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform. Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform, built on a PaaS architecture, provides genomic enterprises with an efficient deployment, flexible scheduling, and user-friendly bioinformatics cloud environment along with various computing resources\n\nFor inquiries about product testing and usage, please contact via email: omics@tencent.com\n"

Using these functions you can:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)\n- \u270d\ufe0f Print log output showing parameters with non-default values\n- \u2705 Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema\n- \ud83d\udccb Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Create a Nextflow channel with a parsed sample sheet\n\nSupported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV and YAML (simple).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-validation'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The snippet above will always try to install the latest version, good to make sure\n> that the latest bug fixes are included! However, this can cause difficulties if running\n> offline. You can pin a specific release using the syntax `nf-validation@0.3.2`\n\nYou can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:\n\n```groovy title=\"main.nf\"\ninclude { validateParameters; paramsHelp; paramsSummaryLog; fromSamplesheet } from 'plugin/nf-validation'\n\n// Print help message, supply typical command line usage for the pipeline\nif (params.help) {\n   log.info paramsHelp(\"nextflow run my_pipeline --input input_file.csv\")\n   exit 0\n}\n\n// Validate input parameters\nvalidateParameters()\n\n// Print summary of supplied parameters\nlog.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)\n\n// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet\n// NB: `input` corresponds to `params.input` and associated sample sheet schema\nch_input = Channel.fromSamplesheet(\"input\")\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Java 11 or later\n- <https://github.com/everit-org/json-schema>\n\n## Slack channel\n\nThere is a dedicated [nf-validation Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C056RQB10LU) in the [Nextflow Slack workspace](nextflow.slack.com).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis plugin was written based on code initially written within the nf-core community,\nas part of the nf-core pipeline template.\n\nWe would like to thank the key contributors who include (but are not limited to):\n\n- J\u00falia Mir Pedrol ([@mirpedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol))\n- Nicolas Vannieuwkerke ([@nvnieuwk](https://github.com/nvnieuwk))\n- Kevin Menden ([@KevinMenden](https://github.com/KevinMenden))\n- Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))\n"

Building and delivering optimized, context-aware container images slows down development. Wave is a container provisioning service designed for use with data analysis applications such as Nextflow. It allows for the on-demand assembly, augmentation, and deployment of containerized images based on task requirements.\n\n\n### More links \n\n- [Wave containers website](https://seqera.io/wave/)\n- [Wave documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html)\n- [Wave usage examples](https://github.com/seqeralabs/wave-showcase)\n\n\nWave containers plugin code is hosted in the [Nextflow repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/tree/master/plugins/nf-wave)"

        "readme": "# nf-weblog plugin \n   \nThis plugin allows Nextflow to send detailed workflow execution metadata and runtime statistics to a HTTP endpoint. \nTo enable this feature, use the `-with-weblog` as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <pipeline name> -with-weblog [url]\n```\n\nOr enable it in the Nextflow configuration:\n\n```groovy\nweblog {\n  enabled = true\n  url = '...'\n}\n```\n\nWorkflow events are sent as HTTP POST requests to the given URL. The message consists of the following JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runName\": \"<run name>\",\n  \"runId\": \"<uuid>\",\n  \"event\": \"<started|process_submitted|process_started|process_completed|error|completed>\",\n  \"utcTime\": \"<UTC timestamp>\",\n  \"trace\": {  },\n  \"metadata\": {  }\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON object contains the following attributes:\n\n- `runName`: The workflow execution run name.\n\n- `runId`: The workflow execution unique ID.\n\n- `event`: The workflow execution event. One of `started`, `process_submitted`, `process_started`, `process_completed`, `error`, `completed`.\n\n- `utcTime`: The UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format.\n\n- `trace`: The task runtime information as described in the [Trace report](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html#trace-report) documentation. The set of included fields is determined by the `trace.fields` setting in the Nextflow configuration file. See the [Trace configuration](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#scope-trace) docs to learn more.\n\n  *Included only for the following events: `process_submitted`, `process_started`, `process_completed`, `error`*\n\n- `metadata`: The workflow metadata including the [config manifest](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#scope-manifest). For a list of all fields, have a look at the bottom message examples.\n\n  *Included only for the following events: `started`, `completed`*\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following configuration options are available:\n\n`weblog.enabled`\n\nIf `true` it will send HTTP POST requests to a given url.\n\n`weblog.url`\n\nThe url where to send HTTP POST requests (default: `http://localhost`).\n\n`weblog.basicToken`\n\nA Basic authentication token to append to each HTTP request. It should be the user ID and password joined by a single colon, for example `USER:PASSWORD`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example `started` event\n\nWhen a workflow execution is started, a message like the following is posted to the specified end-point. Be aware that the properties in the parameter scope will look different for your workflow. Here is an example output from the `nf-core/hlatyping` pipeline with the weblog feature enabled:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runName\": \"friendly_pesquet\",\n  \"runId\":

configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make compile\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-weblog` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-weblog\n    ```\n\n### Test endpoint\n\nThe `echo.py` script can be used to deploy a local server that logs POST requests, which is useful for testing the plugin:\n\n```bash\n./echo.py\n```\n\n## Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n## Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-weblog`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-weblog:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

In the mean time, you can build it\nyourself:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-wr.git\n    cd nf-wr\n    make assemble\n    export NXF_CLASSPATH=$PWD/build/libs/nf-wr-1.0.0.jar\n\n## Usage\n\nTo enable this executor set the property ``process.executor = 'wr'`` in the\n``nextflow.config`` file. See wr's\n[wiki](https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/wr/wiki/Nextflow) for more\ndetails.\n\nThe pipeline can be launched either on a local computer or an OpenStack instance.\n\nTo start running wr, install wr by downloading it, unzipping it and optionally\nplacing it in your $PATH. Then for LSF usage run:\n\n    wr manager start -s lsf\n\nFor OpenStack usage, additionally source your OpenStack credentials \"rc\" file and\nrun:\n\n    wr cloud deploy\n\nYour options to \"deploy\" or your wr configuration determine the default image\nand allowed flavors that will be used to run tasks. Amongst the allowed flavors,\nwr will pick the smallest flavor that is large enough to run your tasks,\naccording to the cpu, memory and disk requirements of each task.\n\nWhen using OpenStack without a shared disk, an S3 bucket must be used as pipeline\nwork directory and for pipeline file inputs. This means nextflow must be configured\nwith access details of your S3 system, and wr must also be aware of those details.\nThis can be arranged most easily by having an ~/.s3cfg file (the file you would need\nfor the s3cmd tool).\n\n## Dir structure\n\n* `src/main`: Module source files\n* `src/resources`: Module non source resources\n* `src/test`: Module unit test sources\n"

If you are interested, please contact us for an evaluation license at [sales@seqera.io](mailto:sales@seqera.io).\n\n## Configuration\n\n1. Define the variable `NFX_XPACK_LICENSE` in your environment, e.g. \n\n    ```\n    export NXF_XPACK_LICENSE=<license string>\n    ```\n\n2. Add in your pipeline `nextflow.config` file the following \nsnippet: \n\n    ```\n    plugins {\n      id 'xpack-amzn@1.5.0'\n    }\n    ``` \n\nThe number after `@` character represents the plugin version. Make sure to use \na version matching your Nextflow version according to the compatibility table \nin the following section. \n\n3. Follow the [documentation](docs.md) for configure feature specific settings (optional).\n\n## Compatibility table\n\n\n| Nextflow version        | Xpack version   |\n|---                      |---              |\n| 24.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.5.0           |\n| 23.12.0-edge (or later) | 1.4.0           |\n| 23.05.0-edge (or later) | 1.3.1           |\n| 23.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.2.1           |\n| 22.01.1-edge (or later) | 1.2.0           |\n| 21.06.0-edge (or later) | 1.1.0           |\n| 21.01.1-edge, 21.04.x (or later) | 1.0.1  |\n\n\n## License  \n\nCopyright 2021-2024, Seqera Labs, S.L.

        "readme": "# Nextflow extension package for Google Cloud (XPACK-GOOGLE)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Nextflow extension package for Google Cloud is a plugin provided by [Seqera Labs](https://www.seqera.io/) that allows the support for [Google Filestore](https://cloud.google.com/filestore) file system when deploying Nextflow pipelines with [Google LifeSciences](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences) and [Google Cloud Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch) computing services.\n\nThe plugin requires a license key to be used. If you are interested, please contact us for an evaluation license at [sales@seqera.io](mailto:sales@seqera.io).\n\n## Prequisites\n\n* Java 11 or later\n* Nextflow `23.01.0-edge` or later\n* Google LifeScience or Google Batch API enabled\n* Google Filestore instance\n\n## Quick start\n\n### 0. instance preparation\n\n- Install Java and the required NFS system dependecies\n\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jdk-headless nfs-common\n    ```\n\n- Install Nextflow:\n\n    ```\n    export NXF_VER=23.01.0-edge\n    curl get.nextflow.io | bash\n    ./nextflow self-update\n    ```\n\n- Configure the Google crendentials defining the variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`\nin the launching environment, e.g.:\n\n    ```\n    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$PWD/google.json\n    ```\n\n- Mount the shared file system in the launching environment:\n\n    ```\n    sudo mkdir /nfs\n    sudo mount 10.195.15.250:/share1 /nfs/\n    sudo chmod  go+rw /nfs\n    ```\n\n    In the above snippet replace the `10.195.15.250:/share1` string with your Filestore\n    instance mount point. See the Google Filestore [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/mounting-fileshares) for details.\n\n\n### 1. License configuration \n\nConfigure the Nextflow XPACK license definining the variable `NXF_XPACK_LICENSE` \nin the launching environment, e.g.:\n\n    export NXF_XPACK_LICENSE=<license string>\n\n\n### 2.1 Plugin configuration for Google Cloud Batch \n\nCreate the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline launching directory with the \nfollowing settings:\n\n    plugins {\n      id 'xpack-google@1.0.0'\n    }\n\n    google.location = 'europe-west2'\n    google.batch.nfsVolumes.nfs1.target = '10.195.15.250:/share1'\n    google.batch.nfsVolumes.nfs1.mountPath = '/nfs'\n    \n    process.executor = 'google-batch' \n\n\nIn the above example replace the *region*, NFS *target* and *mountPath* with \nthe values matching your Filestore instance configuration.\n\nNote: more than one Filestore instance can be configured providing the corresponding \n`target` and `mountPath` values using a unique `nfsVolumes` names for each of them e.g. \n`nfs1`, `nfs2`, etc.\n\n\n### 2.2 Plugin configuration for Google LifeSciences \n\nCreate the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline launching directory with the \nfollowing settings:\n\n    plugins {\n      id 'xpack-google@1.0.0'\n    }\n\n    google.region = 'europe-west2'\n    google.lifeSciences.nfsVolumes.nfs1.target = '10.195.15.250:/share1'\n    google.lifeSciences.nfsVolumes.nfs1.mountPath = '/nfs'\n    \n    process.executor = 'google-lifesciences' \n\nIn the above example replace the *region*, NFS *target* and *mountPath* with \nthe values matching your Filestore instance configuration.\n\nNote: more than one Filestore instance can be configured providing the corresponding \n`target` and `mountPath` values using a unique `nfsVolumes` names for each of them e.g. \n`nfs1`, `nfs2`, etc.\n\n### 3. Launch the pipeline execution\n\n\nLaunch the Nextflow pipeline execution specifying the as work directory a \npath in the shared file system, e.g.:\n\n```\n./nextflow run hello -w /nfs/scratch\n```\n\n## Compatibility table\n\n| Nextflow version        | Xpack version   |\n|---                      |---              |\n| 24.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.2.0           |\n| 23.12.0-edge (or later) | 1.1.0           |\n| 23.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.0.0           |\n| 21.06.0-edge (or later) | 1.0.0-beta.1    |\n\n## License  \n\nCopyright 2021-2023, Seqera Labs, S.L.
