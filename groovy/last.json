Sci. 2021, 2100707. https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100707\n\nThe nf-co2footprint plugin generates a detailed TXT carbon footprint report containing the energy consumption, the estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emission and other relevant metrics for each task.\nAdditionally, an HTML report is generated with information about the carbon footprint of the whole pipeline run and containing plots showing, for instance, an overview of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for the different processes.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-co2footprint@1.0.0-beta'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed. Run your pipeline with the usual command.\n\nYou can find more information on plugins in the [Nextflow documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To test the plugin prior to its first release, refer to the [contributing documentation](contributing/setup.md).\n\n## Credits\n\nThe nf-co2footprint plugin is mainly developed and maintained by [Sabrina Krakau](https://github.com/skrakau) and [J\u00falia Mir-Pedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol) at [QBiC](https://www.qbic.uni-tuebingen.de/).\n\nWe thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:\n\n- [Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels)\n- [Paolo Di Tommaso](https://github.com/pditommaso)"

Otherwise, you can configure the following:\n\n```\nk8s {\n    scheduler {\n        name = 'workflow-scheduler'\n        serviceAccount = 'nextflowscheduleraccount'\n        imagePullPolicy = 'IfNotPresent'\n        cpu = '2'\n        memory = '1400Mi'\n        container = 'commonworkflowscheduler/kubernetesscheduler:v1.0'\n        command = null\n        port = 8080\n        workDir = '/scheduler'\n        runAsUser = 0\n        autoClose = false\n        nodeSelector = null\n    }\n}\n```\n\n| Attribute       | Required | Explanation                                                                                                                  |\n|:----------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| name            | -        | The name of the pod created                                                                                                  |\n| serviceAccount  | -        | Service account used by the scheduler                                                                                        |\n| imagePullPolicy | -        | Image pull policy for the created pod ([k8s docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-pull-policy)) |\n| cpu             | -        | Number of cores to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                 |\n| memory          | -        | Memory to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                          |\n| container       | -        | Container image to use for the scheduler pod                                                                                 |\n| command         | -        | Command to start the CWS in the pod.

        "readme": "# nf-ffq\n\nNextflow plugin to fetch fastq samples using [ffq](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-ffq).\n\n## Get started \n\nThe plugin adds a new channel factory called `channel.ffq()` which can be used to query fastq files.\n\n> [!Note]\n> This plugin requires Nextflow 24.01.0-edge or later.\n\nA simple usage is shown below:\n\n```\ninclude { ffq } from 'plugin/nf-ffq'\n\nchannel\n  .ffq('SRR9990627', filetype: 'fastq', links: 'aws')\n  .view()\n```\n\nRun it using this command:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your script name> -plugins nf-ffq\n```\n\nIt returns: \n\n```\n[SRR9990627, [s3://sra-pub-src-16/SRR9990627/macula_donor_1_S100_L004_R1_001.fastq.gz.1, s3://sra-pub-src-17/SRR9990627/macula_donor_1_S100_L004_R2_001.fastq.gz.1]]\n```\n\n\n## Options\n\nThe `ffq` method can take either a string value representing an accession ID, a string value representing string representing a comma separate list of accession IDs, or a list of string of accession IDs.\n\nThe following options can be specified provided:\n\n| Option \t        | Description \t            |\n|---\t            |---\t                    |\n| `filetype`        | The requested file type, either `fastq` or `sra`\n| `links`           | The link type that should be returned, either `aws`, `gcp`, `ncbi`, `ftp`\n\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe plugin adds a new `ffq` config scope which supports the following options:\n\n| Config option \t| Description \t            |\n|---\t            |---\t                    |\n| `ffq.endpoint`    | URL of the ffq-api endpoint\n\nFor example:\n```\nffq {\n  endpoint = 'https://ffq.seqera.io'\n}\n```\n\n## Development\n\n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n    ./gradlew check\n\n## Run and debug plugin in the development environment\n\nTo run and test the plugin in the development environment, configure a local Nextflow build \nusing the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n\n    ```\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Instruct the plugin build setting to use the local Nextflow code, adding the following \n  line in the file `settings.gradle`: \n   \n    ```\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n  (make sure to not add it more than once..)\n\n3. Compile the plugin along the Nextflow code, with this command:\n\n    ```\n    ./gradlew assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with plugins using the `./launch.sh` script as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command and \n  adding the option `-plugins nf-ffq` to load the built plugin:\n   \n    ```\n    ./launch.sh run ffq.nf -plugins nf-ffq\n    ```\n\n## Package, upload and publish\n\nThe project should hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin,\nthat is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder e.g. `nf-ffq` in this project.\n\nFollowing these step to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes\n   (this file should not be committed in the project repository):\n\n  * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation the plugin project is hosted\n  * `github_username` The GitHub username granting access to the plugin project.\n  * `github_access_token`:  The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes in the plugin repository.\n  * `github_commit_email`:  The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. The following command, package and upload the plugin in the GitHub project releases page:\n\n    ```\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-ffq:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against the [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) \n  project to make the plugin public accessible to Nextflow app. \n"

        "readme": "# nf-float plugin\n\nThis project contains the Nextflow plugin for MemVerge Memory Machine Cloud \n(aka. float).\n\n`FloatGridExecutor` extends the `AbstractGridExecutor` and tells Nextflow how\nto run the workload with `float` command line.  \n\nPlease make sure your nextflow node shares the same work directory with the\nworker nodes/containers.  It should be a shared file system such as NFS or S3FS.\n\nOtherwise, the worker nodes won't be able to see the task files.\n\n## License\n\n[Apache License Version 2.0](./LICENSE)\n\n## Installation\n\nTo run `float` with Nextflow, you must install the Nextflow and the float plugin.\n\n__Note__\n\nNextflow and the plugin should be installed on a node that have \naccess to the NFS which is available to all worker nodes.\n\n### Install Nextflow\n\nEnter this command in your terminal:\n```\ncurl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash\n```\nIt creates a file `nextflow` in the current dir.\n\n__Note__:\n\nNextflow requires java 11 or higher.  You may need to install openjdk 11 \nfor your environment.\n\nYou could always find the latest installation\nguide at https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html.\n\n\n### Install nf-float plugin\n\n#### Auto Install\n\nThe `nf-float` plugin is available on the Nextflow community plugins site.\nWhen Nextflow sees following configuration, it will automatically download\nthe plugin.  \n\nJust make sure you have proper internet access.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n```\n\nThis will download the latest version of the plugin.\n\nIf you need a specific version, you can specify the version number like this:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float@0.4.1'\n}\n```\n\n\n#### Manual Install\n\nSometimes you want to deploy a customized plugin.  In this case, you can\ninstall it manually.\n\nGo to the folder where you just install the `nextflow` command line.\nLet's call this folder the Nextflow home directory.\nCreate the float plugin folder with:\n```bash\nmkdir -p .nextflow/plugins/nf-float-<version>\n```\nwhere `<version>` is the version of the float plugin, such as `0.4.1`.  This version number should \nalign with the version in of your plugin and the property in your configuration\nfile. (check the configuration section)\n\nRetrieve your plugin zip file and unzip it in this folder.\nIf everything goes right, you should be able to see two sub-folders:\n\n```bash\n$ ll .nextflow/plugins/nf-float-<version>/\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x 4 ec2-user ec2-user    51 Jan  5 07:17 classes\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 ec2-user ec2-user    25 Jan  5 07:17 META-INF\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nUsers need to update the default configuration file or supply a configuration\nfile with the command line option `-c`.  Here is a sample of the configuration.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = '/mnt/memverge/shared'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'opcenter.compute.amazonaws.com'\n    username = 'admin'\n    password = 'memverge'\n    nfs = 'nfs://1.2.3.4/mnt/memverge/shared'\n}\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n}\n```\n\n* In the `plugins` section, users must specify the plugin name and version.\n* `workDir` is where we mount the NFS and where Nextflow put the process files.\n* In the `float` section, users must supply the address of the MMCE operation\n  center and the proper credentials.\n* In the `process` scope, we specify `executor = 'float'` to tell Nextflow to execute\n  tasks with the Float executor.\n* In the `process` scope, we can use `ext.float = 'xxx'` to pass extra options to the \n  float command line.  It works the same as `extra`.\n\nAvailable `float` config options: \n\n* `address`: address of your operation center(s).  Separate multiple addresses with `,`.\n* `username`, `password`: the credentials for your operation center\n* `nfs`: the location of the NFS (if using NFS for the work directory)\n* `migratePolicy`: the migration policy used by WaveRider, specified as a map.  Refer to\n              the CLI usage for the list of available options.\n* `vmPolicy`: the VM creation policy, specified as a map.  Refer to the CLI usage\n              for the list of available options.\n* `ignoreTimeLimits`: a boolean.  default to true.  If set to true, the plugin will ignore\n  the time limit of the task.\n* `timeFactor`: a float number.  default to 1.  An extra factor to multiply based \n  on the time supplied by the task.  Add time factor to enlarge the default timeout of the task.  \n  Because WaveRider may take extra time for job migration.\n* `maxCpuFactor`: a float number.  default to 4.  The maximum CPU cores of the instance is set\n  to `maxCpuFactor` * `cpus` of the task.\n* `maxMemoryFactor`: a float number.  default to 4.  The maximum memory of the instance is set\n  to `maxMemoryFactor` * `memory` of the task.\n* `commonExtra`: allows the user to specify other submit CLI options.  This parameter\n                 will be appended to every float submit command.\n* `maxParallelTransfers`: an integer.  default to 4.  The maximum number of parallel transfers\n  for the task happened on the worker node.  Note the actual concurrency is the minimum of this \n  value and the number of available cores.\n\n### Configure with environment variables\n\nThe plugin allows the user to set credentials with environment variables.\nIf the credentials are not available in the configuration file, it will try\nreading these environment variables.\n\n* `MMC_ADDRESS` for operation center address.  Separate multiple addresses with `,`.\n* `MMC_USERNAME` for login username\n* `MMC_PASSWORD` for login password\n\n\n### Configure with Nextflow secrets\n\nUser can use Nextflow secrets to input the credentials.  Here is an example:\n\n```bash\nnextflow secrets set MMC_USERNAME \"...\"\nnextflow secrets set MMC_PASSWORD \"...\"\n```\n\nIn the configuration file, you can reference the secrets like this:\n\n```groovy\nfloat {\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n}\n```\n\nIf the secret is not available, Nextflow reports error like this:\n\n```\nUnknown config secret 'MMC_USERNAME'\n```\n\n### Configuration best practices\n\nWhen you are using s3, it's recommended to update the aws client configurations\nbased on your environment and the workload.  Here is an example:\n```groovy\naws {\n  // recommended aws client settings\n  client {\n    maxConnections = 20 // Increase this number to allow large concurrency\n    maxErrorRetry = 10 // Increase the number of retries if needed\n    connectionTimeout = 60000 // timeout in milliseconds, 60 seconds\n    socketTimeout = 60000     // timeout in milliseconds, 60 seconds\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDue to a compatibility issue between MMC and AWS, when using the us-east-1 region, \nyou must explicitly specify the endpoint as `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`. \nFor example:\n```groovy\naws {\n    client {\n        endpoint = 'https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you are sure that the workflow file is properly composed, it's recommended to\nset proper error strategy and retry limit in the process scope to make sure\nthe workflow can be completed.\nHere is an example:\n```groovy\nprocess {\n  errorStrategy='retry'\n  maxRetries=5  \n}\n```\n\n### Configure s3 work directory\n\nTo enable s3 as work directory, user need to set work directory to a s3 bucket.\nNote `token` is not supported.\nNote `scratch` is enabled by default.  If you want to disable it, please set `scratch = false`.\n`stageInMode` is set to `copy` by default.  If you want to disable it, please set `stageInMode = 'link'`.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = 's3://bucket/path'\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n    container = 'fedora/fedora-minimal'\n    disk = '120 GB'\n}\n\npodman.registry = 'quay.io'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'op.center.address'\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n}\n\naws {\n  accessKey = '***'\n  secretKey = '***'\n  region = 'us-east-2' // optional\n}\n```\n\nYou don't need to specify `nfs` in `float` scope.  The plugin will assemble\nthe `nfs` option automatically.\n\nThe plugin retrieves the s3 credentials in the following order:\n* the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline execution directory\n* read key from `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n* read secret from `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`\n* the default profile in the AWS credentials file located at `~/.aws/credentials`\n* the default profile in the AWS client configuration file located at `~/.aws/config`\n* the temporary AWS credentials provided by an IAM instance role. See IAM Roles documentation for details.\n\nFor detail, check NextFlow's document.\nhttps://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/amazons3.html#security-credentials\n\nTests done for s3 work directory support:\n* trivial sequence and scatter workflow.\n* the test profile of nf-core/rnaseq\n* the test profile of nf-core/sarek\n\nBy default, `scratch` option is set to true, `stageInMode` is set to `copy` for network file system\nsuch as `s3`.\nWhen `scratch` is enabled, the plugin will use the scratch space of the worker node to store the task \nfiles.  This is useful when the task files are large and the network bandwidth is limited.\n\nWhen `scratch` is enabled manually, it's strongly recommended to set `stageInMode = 'copy'` in the \nprocess scope.  This will make sure the task files are copied to the scratch space before the task starts.\n\nIf you want to disable `scratch`, please set `scratch = false` in the process scope.\n\nBecause the scratch space is local, you need to add `disk = '100 GB'` to make sure the task has enough\nspace to run.  The plugin will also check the total input size of the task and make sure the disk space\nis larger than 5 times of the input size.\n\n### Configure s3fs work directory\n\nTo enable s3fs as work directory, user need to set work directory to a s3 bucket.\nNote `token` is optional.  If you don't have a token, you can leave it empty.\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-float'\n}\n\nworkDir = '/s3/bucket'\n\nprocess {\n    executor = 'float'\n    container = 'fedora/fedora-minimal'\n}\n\npodman.registry = 'quay.io'\n\nfloat {\n    address = 'op.center.address'\n    username = secrets.MMC_USERNAME\n    password = secrets.MMC_PASSWORD\n    nfs = 's3://bucket:/s3/bucket'\n    timeFactor = 2\n}\n\naws {\n  accessKey = '***'\n  secretKey = '***'\n  token = '***'\n  region = 'us-east-2'\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin retrieves the s3 credentials in the following order:\n* the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline execution directory\n* read key from `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`\n* read secret from `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY`\n* read token from `AWS_TOKEN` or `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` if applicable\n* the default profile in the AWS credentials file located at `~/.aws/credentials`\n* the default profile in the AWS client configuration file located at `~/.aws/config`\n* the temporary AWS credentials provided by an IAM instance role. See IAM Roles documentation for details.\n\n\n### Configure fusion FS over s3\n\nSince release 0.3.0, we support fusion FS over s3.  To enable fusion, you need to add following configurations\n```groovy\nwave.enabled = true // 1\n\nfusion {\n  enabled = true // 2\n  exportStorageCredentials = true // 3\n  exportAwsAccessKeys = true // 4\n}\n```\n1. fusion needs wave support.\n2. enable fusion explicitly\n3. export the aws credentials as environment variable.\n4. same as 3.  Different nextflow versions may require different option.  Supply both 3 & 4 if you are not sure.\n\nIn additional, you may want to:\n* point your work directory to a location in s3.\n* specify your s3 credentials in the `aws` scope.\n\nWhen fusion is enabled, you can find similar submit command line in your `.nextflow.log`\n```bash\nfloat -a <op-center-address> -u admin -p *** submit\n    --image 'wave.seqera.io/wt/dfd4c4e2d48d/biocontainers/mulled-v2-***:***-0'\n    --cpu 12\n    --mem 72\n    --job /tmp/nextflow5377817282489183149.command.run\n    --env FUSION_WORK=/fusion/s3/cedric-memverge-test/nf-work/work/31/a4b682beb93c944fbd3a342ffc41c5\n    --env AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=***\n    --env AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=***\n    --env 'FUSION_TAGS=[.command.*|.exitcode|.fusion.*](nextflow.io/metadata=true),[*](nextflow.io/temporary=true)'\n    --extraContainerOpts --privileged\n    --customTag nf-job-id:znzjht-4\n```\n* the task image is wrapped by a layer provided by wave.\n  __note__: releases prior to MMC 2.3.1 has bug that fails the image pull requests to the wave registry.  \n  please upgrade to the latest MMC master.\n* `FUSION_WORK` and `FUSION_TAGS` is added as environment variables.\n* aws credentials is added as environment variables.\n* use `extraContainerOpts` to make sure we run the container in privileged mode.\n  __note__: this option requires MMC 2.3 or later.\n\nTests for the fusion support.\n* trivial sequence and scatter workflow.\n* the test profile of nf-core/rnaseq\n* the test profile of nf-core/sarek\n\n### Configure VM creation and migration policies\n\nWhile the VM and migration policies can be specified like any CLI option via `float.commonExtra`,\nthey can also be specified using the config options `float.vmPolicy` and `float.migratePolicy` as maps:\n\n```groovy\nfloat {\n    vmPolicy = [\n        spotFirst: true,\n        retryLimit: 3,\n        retryInterval: '10m'\n    ]\n\n    migratePolicy = [\n        cpu: [upperBoundRatio: 90, upperBoundDuration: '10s'],\n        mem: [lowerBoundRatio: 20, upperBoundRatio: 90]\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n## Process definition\n\nFor each process, users could supply their requirements for the CPU, memory and container image using the standard Nextflow process directives.\nHere is an example of a hello world workflow.\n\n```groovy\nprocess sayHello {\n  executor 'float'\n  container 'cactus'\n  cpus 2\n  memory 4.GB\n  disk 50.GB\n  time '1h'\n\n  output:\n    stdout\n\n  \"\"\"\n  echo \"Hello from Nextflow!\"\n  \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n  sayHello | view { it.trim() }\n}\n```\n\nThe following process directives are supported for specifying task resources:\n\n* `conda` (only when using [Wave](https://seqera.io/wave/))\n* `container`\n* `cpus`\n* `disk` (controls the size of the volume of the workload, minimal size is 40 GB)\n* `machineType`\n* `memory`\n* `resourceLabels`\n* `time`\n\n## Run the Workflow\n\nUse the `nextflow` command to run the workflow.  We need to include our configuration\nfile and task file as arguments.  Here is an example.\n\n```bash\n./nextflow run samples/tutorial.nf -c conf/float-rt.conf\n```\n\n## Unit testing \n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo run and test the plugin in a development environment, \nconfigure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew compileGroovy\n    ```\n   \n4. Run unittest of the package:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew check\n    ```\n\n5. Packaging:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew assemble\n    ```\n\n6. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-float` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run samples/hello.nf -c conf/float-rt.conf -plugins nf-float\n    ```\n\n## Package\n\nRun following command to create the plugin zip.\n\n```bash\n./gradlew makeZip\n```\n\nThe output is available at `./plugins/nf-float/build/libs/`\n"

        "readme": "# nf-ga4gh plugin \n \nThis plugin implements the support for GA4GH APIs for Nextflow. Currently only supports the [Task Execution Service (TES) API](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas).\n\nSee the [Nextflow documentation](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html) for more information about developing plugins.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe [Task Execution Schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas) (TES) project by the [GA4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org) standardization initiative is an effort to define a standardized schema and API for describing batch execution tasks in a portable manner.\n\nNextflow supports the TES API via the `tes` executor, which allows the submission of workflow tasks to a remote execution backend exposing a TES API endpoint.\n\nThe pipeline processes must specify the Docker image to use by defining the `container` directive, either in the pipeline script or the `nextflow.config` file. Additionally, the pipeline work directory must be accessible to the TES backend.\n\nTo enable this executor, add the following settings to your Nextflow configuration:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-ga4gh'\n}\n\nprocess.executor = 'tes'\ntes.endpoint = '<endpoint>'\n```\n\nThe default endpoint is `http://localhost:8000`. It is important that the endpoint is specified without the trailing slash; otherwise, the resulting URLs will not be normalized and the requests to TES will fail.\n\nThe TES API supports multiple forms of authentication:\n\n```groovy\n// basic\ntes.basicUsername = '<username>'\ntes.basicPassword = '<password>'\n\n// API key\ntes.apiKeyParamMode = '<mode>' // 'query' or 'header'\ntes.apiKeyParamName = '<param-name>'\ntes.apiKey = '<key>'\n\n// OAuth\ntes.oauthToken = '<token>'\n```\n\nYou can deploy a local [Funnel](https://ohsu-comp-bio.github.io/funnel/) server using the following command:\n\n```bash\n./funnel server --Server.HTTPPort 8000 --LocalStorage.AllowedDirs $HOME run\n```\n\nWhile the TES API is designed to abstract workflow managers from direct storage access, Nextflow still needs to access the shared work directory used by your TES endpoint. For example, if your TES endpoint is located in Azure and uses Azure Blob storage to store the work directory, you still need to provide the necessary Azure credentials for Nextflow to access the Blob storage.\n\n## Plugin structure\n                    \n- `settings.gradle`\n    \n    Gradle project settings. \n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh`\n    \n    The plugin implementation base directory.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/build.gradle` \n    \n    Plugin Gradle build file. Project dependencies should be added here.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` \n    \n    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.hello.HelloPlugin`.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`\n    \n    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/main` \n\n    The plugin implementation sources.\n\n- `plugins/nf-ga4gh/src/test` \n\n    The plugin unit tests. \n\n\n## Unit testing \n\nTo run your unit tests, run the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-ga4gh` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-ga4gh\n    ```\n\n## Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n## Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-ga4gh`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-ga4gh:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-gpt plugin\n \nnf-gpt is an experimental plugin to integrate GPT prompts into Nextflow scripts. It allows submitting\nprompts via OpenAI API and collect the response in form of structured data for downstream analysis.\n\n## Get started\n\n1. Configure the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) key in your environment by using the following variable:\n\n```bash\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=<your api key>\n```\n\n2. Add the following snippet at the beginning of your script:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { gptPromptForText } from 'plugin/nf-gpt'\n```\n\n3. Use the `gptPromptForText` operator to perform a ChatGPT prompt and get the response.\n\n```\ninclude { gptPromptForText } from 'plugin/nf-gpt'\n\nprintln gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke')\n\n```\n\n4. run using Nextflow as usual\n\n```\nnextflow run <my script>\n```\n\n5. See the folder [examples] for more examples.\n\n\n## Reference \n\n### Function `gptPromptForText` \n\nThe `gptPromptForText` function carries out a Gpt chat prompt and return the corresponding message as response as a string. Example: \n\n\n```nextflow\nprintln gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke')\n```\n\n\nWhen the option `numOfChoices` is specified the response is a list of strings.\n\n```nextflow\ndef response =  gptPromptForText('Tell me a joke', numOfChoices: 3)\nfor( String it : response )\n  println it\n```\n\nAvailable options:\n\n\n| name            | description                                                                                                                      |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `logitBias`     | Accepts an object mapping each token (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100 |\n| `model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`)                                                                               |\n| `maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion                                                        |\n| `numOfChoices`  | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message (default: 1)                                                 |\n| `temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`)                                                               |\n\n\n### Function `gptPromptForData` \n\nThe `gptPromptForData` function carries out a GPT chat prompt and returns the response as a list of \nobjects having the schema specified. For example: \n\n```nextflow \n\ndef query = '''\n        Extract information about a person from In 1968, amidst the fading echoes of Independence Day, \n        a child named John arrived under the calm evening sky. This newborn, bearing the surname Doe, \n        marked the start of a new journey.\n        '''\n\ndef response = gptPromptForData(query, schema: [firstName: 'string', lastName: 'string', birthDate: 'date (YYYY-MM-DD)'])\n\nprintln \"First name: ${response[0].firstName}\"\nprintln \"Last name: ${response[0].lastName}\"\nprintln \"Birth date: ${response[0].birthDate}\"\n```\n\n\nThe following options are available: \n\n\n| name            | description |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| `model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`) |\n| `maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion |\n| `schema`        | The expected strcuture for the result object represented as map object in which represent the attribute name and the value the attribute type |\n| `temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`) |\n\n\n### Configuration file \n\nThe following config options can be specified in the `nextflow.config` file: \n\n\n| name            | description |\n|-----------------|-------------|\n| `gpt.apiKey`        | Your OpenAI API key. If missing it uses the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable | \n| `gpt.endpoint`      | The OpenAI endpoint (defualt: `https://api.openai.com`)   |\n| `gpt.model`         | The AI model to be used (default: `gpt-3.5-turbo`) |\n| `gpt.maxTokens`     | The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion |\n| `gpt.temperature`   | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2 (default: `0.7`) |\n\n\n## Development \n\nTo build and test the plugin during development, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make assemble\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-gpt` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-gpt\n    ```\n\n### Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n### Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-gpt`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-gpt:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-ignite\n\nThis project implements a [Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) executor for [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow).\n\n[Apache Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/) is an in-memory data-grid and clustering platform, and can be used to run Nextflow in a \"cluster\" or \"daemon\" mode.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Java 8\n* Nextflow 21.01.x or later\n\nStarting in Nextflow version 22.01.0-edge, the `nf-ignite` plugin must be explicitly enabled in order to use the Ignite executor.\n\n## Cluster setup\n\nIn order to setup a cluster you will need to run a cluster daemon on each node in your cluster. If you want to use Docker containers with Nextflow, the Docker engine must be installed and be running on each node.\n\nIn its simplest form just launch the Nextflow daemon in each cluster node as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -bg\n```\n\nThe command line option `-bg` launches the node daemon in the background. The output is stored in the log file `.node-nextflow.log`. The daemon process `PID` is saved in the file `.nextflow.pid` in the same folder.\n\n### Multicast discovery\n\nBy default, the Ignite daemon tries to automatically discover all members in the cluster by using the network *multicast* discovery. Note that NOT all networks support this feature (for example Amazon AWS does not).\n\nYou can use the [iperf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf/) tool to check if multicast is available in your network. To test multicast, open a terminal on two machines within the network and run the following command in the first one `iperf -s -u -B 228.1.2.4 -i 1` and `iperf -c 228.1.2.4 -u -T 32 -t 3 -i 1` on the second. If data is being transferred then multicast is working.\n\nIgnite uses the multicast group `228.1.2.4` and port `47400` by default. You can change these values, by using the `cluster.join` command line option, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -cluster.join multicast:224.2.2.3:55701\n```\n\nIn case multicast discovery is not available in your network, you can try one of the following alternative methods:\n\n### Shared file system\n\nSimply provide a path shared across the cluster by a network file system, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -bg -cluster.join path:/net/shared/cluster\n```\n\nThe cluster members will use that path to discover each other.\n\n### IP addresses\n\nProvide a list of pre-configured IP addresses on the daemon launch command line, for example:\n\n```bash\nnextflow node -cluster.join ip:10.0.2.1,10.0.2.2,10.0.2.4\n```\n\n### Advanced options\n\nThe following cluster node configuration options can be used.\n\n| Name                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| join                          | IP address(es) of one or more cluster nodes to which the daemon will join.                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| group                         | The name of the cluster to which this node join.

In order to execute your pipeline in the Ignite cluster you will need to use the Ignite executor, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your pipeline> -process.executor ignite\n```\n\nIf your network does no support multicast discovery, you will need to specify the `joining` strategy as you did for the cluster daemons. For example, using a shared path:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <your pipeline> -process.executor ignite -cluster.join path:/net/shared/path\n```\n\nResource requests and other job characteristics can be controlled using the `cpus`, `disk`, and `memory` process directives.\n\n## MPI Execution\n\nNextflow is able to deploy and self-configure an Ignite cluster on demand, taking advantage of the Open [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) standard that is commonly available in grid and supercomputer facilities.\n\nIn this scenario a Nextflow workflow needs to be executed as an MPI job. Under the hood Nextflow will launch a *driver* process in the first of the nodes, allocated by your job request, and an Ignite daemon in the remaining nodes.\n\nIn practice you will need a launcher script to submit an MPI job request to your batch scheduler/resource manager. The batch scheduler must reserve the compute nodes in an exclusive manner to avoid having multiple Ignite daemons running on the same node. Nextflow must be launched using the `mpirun` utility, as if it were an MPI application, specifying the `--pernode` option.\n\n### Platform LSF\n\nThe following example shows a launcher script for the [Platform LSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_LSF/) resource manager:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#BSUB -oo output_%J.out\n#BSUB -eo output_%J.err\n#BSUB -J <job name>\n#BSUB -q <queue name>\n#BSUB -W 02:00\n#BSUB -x\n#BSUB -n 80\n#BSUB -M 10240\n#BSUB -R \"span[ptile=16]\"\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nmpirun --pernode nextflow run <your-project-name> -with-mpi [pipeline parameters]\n```\n\nIt requests 5 nodes (80 processes, with 16 cpus per node). The `-x` directive allocates the node in an exclusive manner. Nextflow needs to be executed using the `-with-mpi` command line option. It will automatically use `ignite` as the executor.\n\nThe variable `NXF_CLUSTER_SEED` must contain an integer value (in the range 0-16777216) that will unequivocally identify your cluster instance. In the above example it is randomly generated by using the [shuf](http://linux.die.net/man/1/shuf) Linux tool.\n\n### Univa Grid Engine\n\nThe following example shows a launcher script for the [Univa Grid Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univa_Grid_Engine) (aka SGE):\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#$ -cwd\n#$ -j y\n#$ -o <output file name>\n#$ -l virtual_free=10G\n#$ -q <queue name>\n#$ -N <job name>\n#$ -pe ompi 5\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nmpirun --pernode nextflow run <your-project-name> -with-mpi [pipeline parameters]\n```\n\nAs in the previous script it allocates 5 processing nodes. UGE/SGE does not have an option to reserve a node in an exclusive manner. A common workaround is to request the maximum amount of memory or cpus available in the nodes of your cluster.\n\n### SLURM\n\nWhen using SLURM you will need to use `srun` instead of `mpirun` in your launcher script. For example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --job-name=<job name>\n#SBATCH --output=<log file %j>\n#SBATCH --ntasks=5\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16\n#SBATCH --tasks-per-node=1\nexport NXF_CLUSTER_SEED=$(shuf -i 0-16777216 -n 1)\nsrun nextflow run hello.nf -with-mpi\n```\n\nAs before, this allocates 5 processing nodes (`--ntasks=5`) and each node will be able to use up to 16 cpus (`--cpus-per-task=16`). When using SLURM it's not necessary to allocate compute nodes in an exclusive manner. It's even possible to launch more than one Nextflow daemon instance per node, though not suggested.\n\nTo submit the pipeline execution create a file like the above, then use the following command:\n\n```bash\nsbatch <launcher script name>\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor development include the nextflow build in the `settings.gradle` file, then use `./launch.sh` with the usual NF \ncommand line options.\n"

        "readme": "# nf-jarvice\n\nThis plugin has been made to submit Nextflow pipelines into a Jarvice cluster.\n\n## Requirements\n\nUser must have a Jarvice cluster `username` and its associated `apikey`.\n\nTo retrieve account API key, from portal, go into **Account** on the right side, and get apikey by clicking on the eye in the API key field.\n\n![API_KEY](apikey.png)\n\nJobs must then be submitted from a folder shared as persistent vault into the cluster (files transfer is not supported for now).\n\nBest solution if vault is not available outside of the cluster is to launch an interactive shell into an `n0` class node. Then ensure current working directory is under `/data` (which is the default persistent vault folder), then pull nextflow tool, add it to current PATH, add Jarvice settings, and execute the pipeline.\n\n## Example\n\nWe will assume user is already connected to a Jarvice cluster, via an interactive `n0` node.\n\n```\ncd /data\nmkdir mytest\ncd mytest\ngit clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow\nexport PATH=/data/mytest/nextflow:$PATH\n```\n\nIn order to use the plugin, user must provide the following information into the `nextflow.config` file of the project. Create file `/data/mytest/nextflow.config` with the following content:\n\n\n```\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-jarvice@0.6.0'\n}\nprocess {\n    executor = 'jarvice'\n    container = 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n    apiUrl = 'https://cloud.nimbix.net/api'\n    machineType = 'n0'\n    vault {\n        name = 'persistent'\n        readonly = false\n        force = false\n    }\n    user {\n        username = 'myusername'\n        apikey = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace apiUrl, machineType, vault, and user (username and apikey) with your Jarvice user values and desired target machines.\n\nContainer value can be let as it, since it should be defined per steps in the nextflow pipeline file.\n\nNow upload your nextflow pipeline file and data. For this example, create file `test.nf` with the following content:\n\n```\n// Declare syntax version\nnextflow.enable.dsl=2\n\nprocess update_message {\n  container 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n  machineType 'n1'\n\n  output:\n    path \"top_hits.txt\"\n\n    \"\"\"\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n    pwd\n    echo Step 1\n    echo \"Smooth Criminal\" > top_hits.txt\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nprocess add_date {\n  container 'us-docker.pkg.dev/jarvice/images/ubuntu-desktop:bionic'\n  machineType 'n1'\n\n  input:\n    path top_hits\n\n  output:\n    path \"sequences.txt\"\n\n    \"\"\"\n    echo Step 2\n    echo \\$(cat top_hits.txt) \\$(date) > sequences.txt\n    \"\"\"\n}\n\nworkflow {\n   update_message | add_date | view\n}\n```\n\nAnd launch it using:\n\n```\nnextflow run test.nf\n```\n\nJarvice plugin will automatically be downloaded and used as executor. Jobs can be seen in Jarvice portal, like any other jobs."

        "readme": "# nf-nomad plugin\n\nThis plugin implements a Nextflow executor for [Hashicorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io).\n\n\n# Maintainers\n\nPlease note that this is a **community contributed** plugin and is a collaboration between \n\n1. Abhinav Sharma (@abhi18av) as part of his PhD work at the Stellenbosch University and Jorge Aguilera (@jagedn) as a contributor from  Evaluacion y desarrollo de negocios, Spain. \n2. Tomas (@tomiles) and his team from Center For Medical Genetics Ghent, Belgium.\n\nThe contribution roles during the development of initial plugin and testing along with the long term commitments have been discussed in [development and infrastructure group](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-nomad/issues/2#issue-1703543034).\n\nFeel free to reach out to us on the `#platform-nomad` channel on Slack for discussions and feedbacks.\n\n## Plugin Assets\n\n- `settings.gradle`\n\n    Gradle project settings.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad`\n\n    The plugin implementation base directory.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/build.gradle`\n\n    Plugin Gradle build file. Project dependencies should be added here.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`\n\n    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.Nomad.NomadPlugin`.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`\n\n    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/main`\n\n    The plugin implementation sources.\n\n- `plugins/nf-nomad/src/test`\n\n    The plugin unit tests.\n\n## `ExtensionPoint`s\n\n`ExtensionPoint` is the basic interface which uses nextflow-core to integrate plugins into it. It's only a basic interface and serves as starting point for more specialized extensions.\n\n## Unit testing\n\nRun the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):\n\n```bash\n./gradlew check\n```\n\n## Testing and debugging\n\nTo run and test the plugin in a development environment, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow _resources/nextflow\n    ```\n\n2. Generate the nextflow class path\n\n    ```bash\n    cd _resources/nextflow && ./gradlew exportClasspath\n    ```\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n\n    ```bash\n    cd ../../ && ./gradlew compileGroovy\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-nomad` to load the plugin:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run main.nf -plugins nf-nomad\n    ```\n\n## Package, upload and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-nomad`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   - `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n\n\n2. Use the following steps to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n\n    - set the desired `version` value in `gradle.properties` and commit the change in the `master` branch\n    - tag the repo with the version\n    - push *all* changes (the tag fill fire the `release` GH action)\n\n    Once the action is finished a new release is created and all related artifacts attached to it\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n    \n    Use the `json` file created in previous steps\n"

        "readme": "# nf-prov\n\nNextflow plugin to render provenance reports for pipeline runs. Now supporting [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/)!\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe `nf-prov` plugin requires Nextflow version `23.04.0` or later.\n\n*New in version 1.3.0: requires Nextflow 24.10.0 or later.*\n\nTo enable and configure `nf-prov`, include the following snippet to your Nextflow config and update as needed.\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-prov'\n}\n\nprov {\n  enabled = true\n  formats {\n    legacy {\n      file = 'manifest.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, run your Nextflow pipeline. You do not need to modify your pipeline script in order to use the `nf-prov` plugin. The plugin will automatically generate a JSON file with provenance information.\n\n## Configuration\n\n*The `file`, `format`, and `overwrite` options have been deprecated since version 1.2.0. Use `formats` instead.*\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`prov.enabled`\n\nCreate the provenance report (default: `true` if plugin is loaded).\n\n`prov.formats`\n\n*New in version 1.2.0*\n\nConfiguration scope for the desired output formats. The following formats are available:\n\n- `bco`: Render a [BioCompute Object](https://biocomputeobject.org/). Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\n  *New in version 1.3.0*: additional \"pass-through\" options are available for BCO fields that can't be inferred from the pipeline. See [BCO.md](./BCO.md) for more information.\n\n- `dag`: Render the task graph as a Mermaid diagram embedded in an HTML document. Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\n- `legacy`: Render the legacy format originally defined in this plugin (default). Supports the `file` and `overwrite` options.\n\nAny number of formats can be specified, for example:\n\n```groovy\nprov {\n  formats {\n    bco {\n      file = 'bco.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n    legacy {\n      file = 'manifest.json'\n      overwrite = true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`prov.patterns`\n\nList of file patterns to include in the provenance report, from the set of published files. By default, all published files are included.\n\n## Development\n\nRun the following commands to build and test the nf-prov Nextflow plugin. Refer to the [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) README for additional instructions (_e.g._ for publishing the plugin).\n\n```bash\n# (Optional) Checkout relevant feature branch\n# git checkout <branch>\n\n# Create an empty folder for nf-prov and nextflow repos\ngit clone --depth 1 -b STABLE-23.10.x https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n\n# Prepare the nextflow repo\ncd ../nextflow && ./gradlew compile exportClasspath && cd -\n\n# Prepare the nf-prov repo\ngrep -v 'includeBuild' settings.gradle > settings.gradle.bkp\necho \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle.bkp\nmv -f settings.gradle.bkp settings.gradle\n./gradlew assemble\n\n# Launch\n./launch.sh run test.nf -plugins nf-prov\n```\n\n## Package, Upload, and Publish\n\nThe project should hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin,\nthat is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder e.g. `nf-prov` in this project.\n\nFollowing these step to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes\n   (this file should not be committed in the project repository):\n\n  * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation the plugin project is hosted\n  * `github_username` The GitHub username granting access to the plugin project.\n  * `github_access_token`:  The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes in the plugin repository.\n  * `github_commit_email`:  The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Update the `Plugin-Version` field in the following file with the release version:\n\n    ```bash\n    plugins/nf-prov/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n    ```\n\n3. Run the following command to package and upload the plugin in the GitHub project releases page:\n\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-prov:upload\n    ```\n\n4. Create a pull request against the [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) \n  project to make the plugin public accessible to Nextflow app. \n\n"

WHen you launch a pipeline with the `nf-quilt` plugin, it will publish a Quilt package upon workflow completion that contains output files published to S3.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo use the `nf-quilt` plugin, you need Nextflow 22.04 (or later) and Python 3.7 (or later).\n\nInstall the [quilt-cli](./quilt-cli) Python package:\n```bash\npip3 install git+https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-quilt.git#subdirectory=quilt-cli\n```\n\nAdd the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` to enable the plugin:\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-quilt'\n}\n```\n\nConfigure the plugin with the `quilt` config scope in your `nextflow.config`. At a minimum, you should specify the package name and registry. You can also specify a list of paths to include in the Quilt package; by default, the plugin will include all output files that were published to S3.\n\n_TIP: It is recommended that you use `publishDir` to select outputs for the Quilt package, rather than `quilt.paths`, so that the Quilt package matches the actual workflow outputs._\n\nHere's an example based on `nf-core/rnaseq`:\n```groovy\nquilt {\n  packageName = 'genomes/yeast'\n  registry = 's3://seqera-quilt'\n  message = 'My commit message'\n  meta = [pipeline: 'nf-core/rnaseq']\n  force = false\n}\n```\n\nFinally, run your Nextflow pipeline with your config file. You do not need to modify your pipeline script in order to use the `nf-quilt` plugin. As long as your pipeline publishes the desired output files to S3, the plugin will automatically publish a Quilt package based on your configuration settings.\n\n## Reference\n\nThe plugin exposes a new `quilt` config scope which supports the following options:\n\n| Config option \t  | Description \t          |\n|---\t              |---\t                      |\n| `quilt.packageName` | Name of package, in the USER/PKG format\n| `quilt.registry`    | Registry where to create the new package\n| `quilt.message`     | The commit message for the new package\n| `quilt.meta`        | Package-level metadata in the form of key-value pairs\n| `quilt.force`       | Skip the parent top hash check and create a new revision even if your local state is behind the remote registry\n| `quilt.paths`       | List of published files (can be path or glob) to include in the package\n\n## Tower\n\nTo use nf-quilt with Nextflow Tower, add the following lines to your pre-run script:\n```bash\nyum install python3-pip -y\nyum install git -y\npip3 install git+https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-quilt.git#subdirectory=quilt-cli\n```\n\n## Development\n\nRefer to the [nf-hello](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hello) README for instructions on how to build, test, and publish Nextflow plugins.\n"

Please follow the [migration guide](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-schema/latest/migration_guide/) to migrate your code to this new version.\n\nThis [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides functionality that can be used in a Nextflow pipeline to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. The added functionality is:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)\n- \u270d\ufe0f Print log output showing parameters with non-default values\n- \u2705 Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema\n- \ud83d\udccb Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Create a type-casted list from a parsed sample sheet\n\nSupported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV, JSON and YAML.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-schema@2.2.0'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The snippet above will always try to install the specified version. We encourage always pinning the\n> plugin version to make sure the used pipeline will keep working when a new version of `nf-schema`\n> with breaking changes has been released.\n\nYou can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:\n\n```groovy title=\"main.nf\"\ninclude { validateParameters; paramsSummaryLog; samplesheetToList } from 'plugin/nf-schema'\n\n// Validate input parameters\nvalidateParameters()\n\n// Print summary of supplied parameters\nlog.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)\n\n// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet passed to the pipeline through the --input parameter\nch_input = Channel.fromList(samplesheetToList(params.input, \"assets/schema_input.json\"))\n```\n\nOr enable the creation of the help message (using `--help`) in the configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nvalidation {\n  help {\n    enabled: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Java 11 or later\n- <https://github.com/harrel56/json-schema>\n- Nextflow 23.10.0 or later\n\n## Slack channel\n\nThere is a dedicated [nf-schema Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C056RQB10LU) in the [Nextflow Slack workspace](https://nextflow.slack.com).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis plugin was written based on code initially written within the nf-core community,\nas part of the nf-core pipeline template.\n\nWe would like to thank the key contributors who include (but are not limited to):\n\n- J\u00falia Mir Pedrol ([@mirpedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol))\n- Nicolas Vannieuwkerke ([@nvnieuwk](https://github.com/nvnieuwk))\n- Kevin Menden ([@KevinMenden](https://github.com/KevinMenden))\n- Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))\n- Arthur ([@awgymer](https://github.com/awgymer))\n"

        "readme": "# SQL DB plugin for Nextflow\n\nThis plugin provides support for interacting with SQL databases in Nextflow scripts.\n\nThe following databases are currently supported:\n\n* [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) (Setup guide [here](docs/aws-athena.md))\n* [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)\n* [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) (Setup guide [here](docs/google-bigquery.md))\n* [H2](https://www.h2database.com)\n* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)\n* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)\n* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)\n* [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)\n\nNOTE: THIS IS A PREVIEW TECHNOLOGY, FEATURES AND CONFIGURATION SETTINGS CAN CHANGE IN FUTURE RELEASES.\n\n## Getting started\n\nThis plugin requires Nextflow `22.08.1-edge` or later. You can enable the plugin by adding the following snippet to your `nextflow.config` file:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-sqldb'\n}\n```\n\nSupport for BigQuery is provided in a separate plugin:\n\n```groovy\nplugins {\n    id 'nf-bigquery'\n}\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can configure any number of databases under the `sql.db` configuration scope. For example:\n\n```groovy\nsql {\n    db {\n        foo {\n            url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/demo'\n            user = 'my-user'\n            password = 'my-password'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above example defines a database named `foo` that connects to a MySQL server running locally at port 3306 and\nusing the `demo` schema, with `my-name` and `my-password` as credentials.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.url`\n: The database connection URL based on the [JDBC standard](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/connecting.html#db_connection_url).\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.driver`\n: The database driver class name (optional).\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.user`\n: The database connection user name.\n\n`sql.db.'<DB-NAME>'.password`\n: The database connection password.\n\n## Dataflow Operators\n\nThis plugin provides the following dataflow operators for querying from and inserting into database tables.\n\n### fromQuery\n\nThe `fromQuery` factory method queries a SQL database and creates a channel that emits a tuple for each row in the corresponding result set. For example:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { fromQuery } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel.fromQuery('select alpha, delta, omega from SAMPLE', db: 'foo').view()\n```\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`db`\n: The database handle. It must be defined under `sql.db` in the Nextflow configuration.\n\n`batchSize`\n: Query the data in batches of the given size. This option is recommended for queries that may return large a large result set, so that the entire result set is not loaded into memory at once.\n: *NOTE:* this feature requires that the underlying SQL database supports `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`.\n\n`emitColumns`\n: When `true`, the column names in the `SELECT` statement are emitted as the first tuple in the resulting channel.\n\n### sqlInsert\n\nThe `sqlInsert` operator collects the items in a source channel and inserts them into a SQL database. For example:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { sqlInsert } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel\n    .of('Hello','world!')\n    .map( it -> tuple(it, it.length) )\n    .sqlInsert( into: 'SAMPLE', columns: 'NAME, LEN', db: 'foo' )\n```\n\nThe above example executes the following SQL statements into the database `foo` (as defined in the Nextflow configuration).\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO SAMPLE (NAME, LEN) VALUES ('HELLO', 5);\nINSERT INTO SAMPLE (NAME, LEN) VALUES ('WORLD!', 6);\n```\n\n*NOTE:* the target table (e.g. `SAMPLE` in the above example) must be created beforehand.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n`db`\n: The database handle. It must be defined under `sql.db` in the Nextflow configuration.\n\n`into`\n: The target table for inserting the data.\n\n`columns`\n: The database table column names to be filled with the channel data. The column names order and cardinality must match the tuple values emitted by the channel. The columns can be specified as a list or as a string of comma-separated values.\n\n`statement`\n: The SQL `INSERT` statement to execute, using `?` as a placeholder for the actual values, for example: `insert into SAMPLE(X,Y) values (?,?)`. The `into` and `columns` options are ignored when this option is provided.\n\n`batchSize`\n: Insert the data in batches of the given size (default: `10`).\n\n`setup`\n: A SQL statement that is executed before inserting the data, e.g. to create the target table.\n: *NOTE:* the underlying database should support the *create table if not exist* idiom, as the plugin will execute this statement every time the script is run.\n\n## Querying CSV files\n\nThis plugin supports the [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) database engine, which can query CSV files like database tables using SQL statements.\n\nFor example, create a CSV file using the snippet below:\n\n```bash\ncat <<EOF > test.csv\nfoo,bar\n1,hello\n2,ciao\n3,hola\n4,bonjour\nEOF\n```\n\nThen query it in a Nextflow script:\n\n```nextflow\ninclude { fromQuery } from 'plugin/nf-sqldb'\n\nchannel\n    .fromQuery(\"SELECT * FROM CSVREAD('test.csv') where foo>=2;\")\n    .view()\n```\n\nThe `CSVREAD` function provided by the H2 database engine allows you to query any CSV file in your filesystem. As shown in the example, you can use standard SQL clauses like `SELECT` and `WHERE` to define your query.\n\n## Caveats\n\nLike all dataflow operators in Nextflow, the operators provided by this plugin are executed asynchronously.\n\nIn particular, data inserted using the `sqlInsert` operator is *not* guaranteed to be available to any subsequent queries using the `fromQuery` operator, as it is not possible to make a channel factory operation dependent on some upstream operation.\n"

Through this component, it can also implement some detailed function adaptations required by the platform, such as metadata file generation, to ensure the efficient operation and management of the workflow. Its design goal is to extend Tencent Cloud's native support for Nextflow workflows, allowing users to run Nextflow workflows using Tencent Cloud resources in a simple and easy-to-use manner.\n\nwe use [Task Execution Schema](https://github.com/ga4gh/task-execution-schemas) (TES) protocol as the protocol for nextflow to dock with the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform. Compared to the official plugin, we utilize some custom fields to adapt to the platform features.\n\n## Feature\n\n- Supports docking with Tencent Cloud COS object storage, allowing direct dependence on Tencent Cloud files in files and configurations.\n- Supports docking with Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform for quick access to high-performance elastic computing capabilities (For more information about Tencent Health Genomics Platform, please refer to: [Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform](https://tencentcloud.com/products/omics)).\n\n## Installation\n\n- Make sure that nextflow is already installed on your system.\n- Run the following command to install nf-tencentcloud.\n  ```bash\n  nextflow plugin install nf-tencentcloud\n  ```\n  You can install the nf-tencentcloud plugin that meets your current environment.\n- You can also specify the plugin in the configuration file for installation.\n  ```groovy\n  plugins {\n      id 'nf-tencentcloud@2.0.2'\n  }\n  ```\n- Or you can use the -plugins command line option.\n  ```bash\n  nextflow run <pipeline> -plugins nf-tencentcloud@2.0.2\n  ```\n\n## Using Tencent Cloud Object Storage\n\nThis plugin integrates COS object storage support, and you can conveniently integrate and use Tencent Cloud object storage in nextflow after completing the object storage-related service opening in Tencent Cloud.\n\nGet the key on the [Tencent Cloud CAM console page](https://console.tencentcloud.com/cam/capi) and follow the steps below:\n- Configure the key in the nextflow configuration file.\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      secretId = \"your_secret_id\"\n      secretKey = \"your_secret_key\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- If you use temporary key authorization, you can configure accessToken to enable temporary key.\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      secretId = \"your_secret_id\"\n      secretKey = \"your_secret_key\"\n      accessToken = \"your_access_token\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n- After the configuration is complete, you can use COS storage anywhere in the process and configuration, such as:\n  ```groovy\n  workDir = \"cos://test-bucket-1258888888/nextflow/workdir\"\n  ```\n\n## Using Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform\n\nThis plugin integrates the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform executor, and you can enable sandbox in the omics platform for debugging, or wait for the subsequent opening of the external network access terminal interface, and use the elastic computing resources provided by the Tencent Genomics Platform after making the corresponding configuration on your own computer.\n\nIn order to use the Tencent Health Genomics Platform executor, you need to activate and [use the Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1234/61467) on Tencent Cloud, and then follow the steps below:\n\n- You need to obtain the request endpoint and accessToken in the omics platform for interface calling and authentication, and configure them in the nextflow configuration file as follows:\n  ```groovy\n  tencentcloud {\n      omics {\n          endpoint = \"http://your_endpoint/api\"\n          accessToken = \"your_access_token\"\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n  > Please note: The accessToken here is used for Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform oauth authentication, which is different from the Tencent Cloud cam temporary authorization accessToken mentioned above, and cannot be mixed.\n  \n- After completing the relevant configuration, set the executor to `tencentcloud-omics` to use the elastic computing capabilities of the Tencent Health Genomics Platform.\n  ```groovy\n  process {\n      executor = 'tencentcloud-omics'\n  }\n  ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor more information about contributing issues or pull requests, see our [nf-tencentcloud Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\u3002\n\n## License\n\nnf-tencentcloud is under the Apache-2.0. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.\n\n## Support\n\nThis plugin is developed by Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform team and can be used upon Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform. Tencent Healthcare Omics Platform, built on a PaaS architecture, provides genomic enterprises with an efficient deployment, flexible scheduling, and user-friendly bioinformatics cloud environment along with various computing resources\n\nFor inquiries about product testing and usage, please contact via email: omics@tencent.com\n"

        "readme": "# ![nf-validation](docs/images/nf-validation.svg)\n\n**A Nextflow plugin to work with validation of pipeline parameters and sample sheets.**\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> # `nf-validation` has now been renamed to `nf-schema`.\n> **The `nf-validation` plugin will not receive any future updates.**\n> **Please update your pipelines to use [`nf-schema`](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-schema) instead.**\n> \n> See <https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-schema> for details.\n>\n> This change was necessary to prevent older versions of `nf-core` pipelines from with unpinned plugin references from breaking when updating to the latest version of `nf-validation`.\n> **Please pin the version of `nf-schema` in your pipeline's `nextflow.config` file:**\n> ```nextflow\n> plugins { id 'nf-schema@2.0.0' }\n> ```\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides a number of functions that can be included into a Nextflow pipeline script to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. Using these functions you can:\n\n- \ud83d\udcd6 Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)\n- \u270d\ufe0f Print log output showing parameters with non-default values\n- \u2705 Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema\n- \ud83d\udccb Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Create a Nextflow channel with a parsed sample sheet\n\nSupported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV and YAML (simple).\n\n## Quick Start\n\nDeclare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:\n\n```groovy title=\"nextflow.config\"\nplugins {\n  id 'nf-validation'\n}\n```\n\nThis is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The snippet above will always try to install the latest version, good to make sure\n> that the latest bug fixes are included! However, this can cause difficulties if running\n> offline. You can pin a specific release using the syntax `nf-validation@0.3.2`\n\nYou can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:\n\n```groovy title=\"main.nf\"\ninclude { validateParameters; paramsHelp; paramsSummaryLog; fromSamplesheet } from 'plugin/nf-validation'\n\n// Print help message, supply typical command line usage for the pipeline\nif (params.help) {\n   log.info paramsHelp(\"nextflow run my_pipeline --input input_file.csv\")\n   exit 0\n}\n\n// Validate input parameters\nvalidateParameters()\n\n// Print summary of supplied parameters\nlog.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)\n\n// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet\n// NB: `input` corresponds to `params.input` and associated sample sheet schema\nch_input = Channel.fromSamplesheet(\"input\")\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Java 11 or later\n- <https://github.com/everit-org/json-schema>\n\n## Slack channel\n\nThere is a dedicated [nf-validation Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C056RQB10LU) in the [Nextflow Slack workspace](nextflow.slack.com).\n\n## Credits\n\nThis plugin was written based on code initially written within the nf-core community,\nas part of the nf-core pipeline template.\n\nWe would like to thank the key contributors who include (but are not limited to):\n\n- J\u00falia Mir Pedrol ([@mirpedrol](https://github.com/mirpedrol))\n- Nicolas Vannieuwkerke ([@nvnieuwk](https://github.com/nvnieuwk))\n- Kevin Menden ([@KevinMenden](https://github.com/KevinMenden))\n- Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels))\n"

Building and delivering optimized, context-aware container images slows down development. Wave is a container provisioning service designed for use with data analysis applications such as Nextflow. It allows for the on-demand assembly, augmentation, and deployment of containerized images based on task requirements.\n\n\n### More links \n\n- [Wave containers website](https://seqera.io/wave/)\n- [Wave documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/wave.html)\n- [Wave usage examples](https://github.com/seqeralabs/wave-showcase)\n\n\nWave containers plugin code is hosted in the [Nextflow repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/tree/master/plugins/nf-wave)"

        "readme": "# nf-weblog plugin \n   \nThis plugin allows Nextflow to send detailed workflow execution metadata and runtime statistics to a HTTP endpoint. \nTo enable this feature, use the `-with-weblog` as shown below:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run <pipeline name> -with-weblog [url]\n```\n\nOr enable it in the Nextflow configuration:\n\n```groovy\nweblog {\n  enabled = true\n  url = '...'\n}\n```\n\nWorkflow events are sent as HTTP POST requests to the given URL. The message consists of the following JSON structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runName\": \"<run name>\",\n  \"runId\": \"<uuid>\",\n  \"event\": \"<started|process_submitted|process_started|process_completed|error|completed>\",\n  \"utcTime\": \"<UTC timestamp>\",\n  \"trace\": {  },\n  \"metadata\": {  }\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON object contains the following attributes:\n\n- `runName`: The workflow execution run name.\n\n- `runId`: The workflow execution unique ID.\n\n- `event`: The workflow execution event. One of `started`, `process_submitted`, `process_started`, `process_completed`, `error`, `completed`.\n\n- `utcTime`: The UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format.\n\n- `trace`: The task runtime information as described in the [Trace report](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html#trace-report) documentation. The set of included fields is determined by the `trace.fields` setting in the Nextflow configuration file. See the [Trace configuration](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#scope-trace) docs to learn more.\n\n  *Included only for the following events: `process_submitted`, `process_started`, `process_completed`, `error`*\n\n- `metadata`: The workflow metadata including the [config manifest](https://nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#scope-manifest). For a list of all fields, have a look at the bottom message examples.\n\n  *Included only for the following events: `started`, `completed`*\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe following configuration options are available:\n\n`weblog.enabled`\n\nIf `true` it will send HTTP POST requests to a given url.\n\n`weblog.url`\n\nThe url where to send HTTP POST requests (default: `http://localhost`).\n\n`weblog.basicToken`\n\nA Basic authentication token to append to each HTTP request. It should be the user ID and password joined by a single colon, for example `USER:PASSWORD`.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example `started` event\n\nWhen a workflow execution is started, a message like the following is posted to the specified end-point. Be aware that the properties in the parameter scope will look different for your workflow. Here is an example output from the `nf-core/hlatyping` pipeline with the weblog feature enabled:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"runName\": \"friendly_pesquet\",\n  \"runId\":

configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:\n\n1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:\n    ```bash\n    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow\n    ```\n  \n2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    echo \"includeBuild('../nextflow')\" >> settings.gradle\n    ```\n  \n   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)\n\n3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:\n    ```bash\n    make compile\n    ```\n\n4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-weblog` to load the plugin:\n    ```bash\n    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-weblog\n    ```\n\n### Test endpoint\n\nThe `echo.py` script can be used to deploy a local server that logs POST requests, which is useful for testing the plugin:\n\n```bash\n./echo.py\n```\n\n## Testing without Nextflow build\n\nThe plugin can be tested without using a local Nextflow build using the following steps:\n\n1. Build the plugin: `make buildPlugins`\n2. Copy `build/plugins/<your-plugin>` to `$HOME/.nextflow/plugins`\n3. Create a pipeline that uses your plugin and run it: `nextflow run ./my-pipeline-script.nf`\n\n## Package, upload, and publish\n\nThe project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name matches the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-weblog`).\n\nFollow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:\n\n1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):\n\n   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.\n   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.\n   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.\n\n2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:\n    ```bash\n    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-weblog:upload\n    ```\n\n3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.\n"

In the mean time, you can build it\nyourself:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-wr.git\n    cd nf-wr\n    make assemble\n    export NXF_CLASSPATH=$PWD/build/libs/nf-wr-1.0.0.jar\n\n## Usage\n\nTo enable this executor set the property ``process.executor = 'wr'`` in the\n``nextflow.config`` file. See wr's\n[wiki](https://github.com/VertebrateResequencing/wr/wiki/Nextflow) for more\ndetails.\n\nThe pipeline can be launched either on a local computer or an OpenStack instance.\n\nTo start running wr, install wr by downloading it, unzipping it and optionally\nplacing it in your $PATH. Then for LSF usage run:\n\n    wr manager start -s lsf\n\nFor OpenStack usage, additionally source your OpenStack credentials \"rc\" file and\nrun:\n\n    wr cloud deploy\n\nYour options to \"deploy\" or your wr configuration determine the default image\nand allowed flavors that will be used to run tasks. Amongst the allowed flavors,\nwr will pick the smallest flavor that is large enough to run your tasks,\naccording to the cpu, memory and disk requirements of each task.\n\nWhen using OpenStack without a shared disk, an S3 bucket must be used as pipeline\nwork directory and for pipeline file inputs. This means nextflow must be configured\nwith access details of your S3 system, and wr must also be aware of those details.\nThis can be arranged most easily by having an ~/.s3cfg file (the file you would need\nfor the s3cmd tool).\n\n## Dir structure\n\n* `src/main`: Module source files\n* `src/resources`: Module non source resources\n* `src/test`: Module unit test sources\n"

If you are interested, please contact us for an evaluation license at [sales@seqera.io](mailto:sales@seqera.io).\n\n## Prequisites\n\n* Java 11 or later\n* Nextflow `23.01.0-edge` or later\n* Google LifeScience or Google Batch API enabled\n* Google Filestore instance\n\n## Quick start\n\n### 0. instance preparation\n\n- Install Java and the required NFS system dependecies\n\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get -y install openjdk-11-jdk-headless nfs-common\n    ```\n\n- Install Nextflow:\n\n    ```\n    export NXF_VER=23.01.0-edge\n    curl get.nextflow.io | bash\n    ./nextflow self-update\n    ```\n\n- Configure the Google crendentials defining the variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`\nin the launching environment, e.g.:\n\n    ```\n    export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$PWD/google.json\n    ```\n\n- Mount the shared file system in the launching environment:\n\n    ```\n    sudo mkdir /nfs\n    sudo mount 10.195.15.250:/share1 /nfs/\n    sudo chmod  go+rw /nfs\n    ```\n\n    In the above snippet replace the `10.195.15.250:/share1` string with your Filestore\n    instance mount point. See the Google Filestore [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/docs/mounting-fileshares) for details.\n\n\n### 1. License configuration \n\nConfigure the Nextflow XPACK license definining the variable `NXF_XPACK_LICENSE` \nin the launching environment, e.g.:\n\n    export NXF_XPACK_LICENSE=<license string>\n\n\n### 2.1 Plugin configuration for Google Cloud Batch \n\nCreate the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline launching directory with the \nfollowing settings:\n\n    plugins {\n      id 'xpack-google@1.0.0'\n    }\n\n    google.location = 'europe-west2'\n    google.batch.nfsVolumes.nfs1.target = '10.195.15.250:/share1'\n    google.batch.nfsVolumes.nfs1.mountPath = '/nfs'\n    \n    process.executor = 'google-batch' \n\n\nIn the above example replace the *region*, NFS *target* and *mountPath* with \nthe values matching your Filestore instance configuration.\n\nNote: more than one Filestore instance can be configured providing the corresponding \n`target` and `mountPath` values using a unique `nfsVolumes` names for each of them e.g. \n`nfs1`, `nfs2`, etc.\n\n\n### 2.2 Plugin configuration for Google LifeSciences \n\nCreate the `nextflow.config` file in the pipeline launching directory with the \nfollowing settings:\n\n    plugins {\n      id 'xpack-google@1.0.0'\n    }\n\n    google.region = 'europe-west2'\n    google.lifeSciences.nfsVolumes.nfs1.target = '10.195.15.250:/share1'\n    google.lifeSciences.nfsVolumes.nfs1.mountPath = '/nfs'\n    \n    process.executor = 'google-lifesciences' \n\nIn the above example replace the *region*, NFS *target* and *mountPath* with \nthe values matching your Filestore instance configuration.\n\nNote: more than one Filestore instance can be configured providing the corresponding \n`target` and `mountPath` values using a unique `nfsVolumes` names for each of them e.g. \n`nfs1`, `nfs2`, etc.\n\n### 3. Launch the pipeline execution\n\n\nLaunch the Nextflow pipeline execution specifying the as work directory a \npath in the shared file system, e.g.:\n\n```\n./nextflow run hello -w /nfs/scratch\n```\n\n## Compatibility table\n\n| Nextflow version        | Xpack version   |\n|---                      |---              |\n| 24.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.2.0           |\n| 23.12.0-edge (or later) | 1.1.0           |\n| 23.01.0-edge (or later) | 1.0.0           |\n| 21.06.0-edge (or later) | 1.0.0-beta.1    |\n\n## License  \n\nCopyright 2021-2023, Seqera Labs, S.L.
