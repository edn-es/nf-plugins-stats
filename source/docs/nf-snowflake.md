# nf-snowflake plugin

## Overview 
nf-snowflake is a [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/overview.html) plugin which allows Nextflow pipeline to be run inside [Snowpark Container Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/overview).

This plugin requires both Nextflow main process and worker process being run as a container job inside Snowflake. Each process/task in Nextflow will be translated to a [Snowflake Job Service](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/execute-job-service). The main process can be a job service or a long-running service. Intermediate result between different Nextflow processes will be shared via [stage mount](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/snowflake-stage-volume), so the same stage mount configuration needs to be applied to both main process container and worker process container.

## QuickStart

This quick start guide assumes you are familiar with both Nextflow and Snowpark Container Service.

1. Create a compute pool
```
CREATE COMPUTE POOL cp
MIN_NODES = 2
MAX_NODES = 2
INSTANCE_FAMILY = CPU_X64_M
auto_suspend_secs=3600
;
```
2. Create External Access Integration to allow cloud blob storage service access. You can follow the steps [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/additional-considerations-services-jobs#network-egress).
3. Create Snowflake Internal Stage for working directory and publish directory
```
create or replace stage nxf_runtime encryption=(type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
create or replace stage results_st encryption=(type = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');
```
4. Build the container image for each Nextflow [process](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/process.html), upload the image to [Snowflake Image Registry](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-container-services/working-with-registry-repository) and update the each process's [container](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/reference/process.html#process-container) field.
e.g.
```
process INDEX {
    tag "$transcriptome.simpleName"
    container '/db/schema/repo/image_name:1.0'

    input:
    path transcriptome

    output:
    path 'index'

    script:
    """
    salmon index --threads $task.cpus -t $transcriptome -i index
    """
}
```
5. Add a snowflake profile to the nextflow.config file and enable nf-snowflake plugin e.g.
```
...
plugins {
  id 'nf-snowflake@0.6.0'
}
...
  snowflake {
    process.executor = 'snowflake'
    snowflake {
      computePool = 'CP'
      stageMounts = '@nxf_runtime:/config/runtime,@results_st:/config/results'
      externalAccessIntegrations='EAI'
    }
  }
...
```
6. Build the container image for Nextflow main process, you will need to include nf-snowflake plugin. You might consider include your Nextflow pipeline code as well. Here is a sample Dockerfile:
```
FROM nextflow/nextflow:24.04.1

RUN nextflow plugin install nf-snowflake
COPY . /rnaseq-nf
WORKDIR /rnaseq-nf
```
7. Start the container service to trigger the pipeline:
```
execute job service
in compute pool CP
name = NXF_MAIN
EXTERNAL_ACCESS_INTEGRATIONS=(EAI)
from specification '
spec:
  container:
  - name: main
    image: /db/schena/repo/nf-main:1.0
    command:
    - nextflow
    - run
    - .
    - -profile
    - snowflake
    - -work-dir
    - /config/runtime
    volumeMounts:
    - name: runtime
      mountPath: /config/runtime
    - name: results
      mountPath: /config/results
  volumes:
  - name: runtime
    source: "@nxf_runtime"
  - name: results
    source: "@results_st"
'
;
```
