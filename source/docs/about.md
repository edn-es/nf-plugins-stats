## Welcome! 

This site was developed by EDN.es as an altruistic endeavor. His primary goal is to provide much-needed visibility to the Nextflow plugin ecosystem, making it easier for users to discover and utilize these valuable tools.

Our passion for the Nextflow community drives this project. We believes that by centralizing information and showcasing the diverse range of available plugins, we can help researchers and developers alike streamline their bioinformatics workflows and unlock new possibilities. This site is a testament to the power of open-source collaboration and aims to foster a more connected and efficient Nextflow community.

## Custom Development
